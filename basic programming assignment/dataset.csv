According to the Program for Early Parent Support, ¡°children benefit from hearing another adult read to them, from watching other children get engaged in a story, and from being exposed to a wide variety of authors and writing styles. Your child will also learn some essential school readiness skills, like how to sit still for an extended period of time, how to pay attention to an adult other than his parents, how to take turns, and how to be (reasonably) quiet in a public place.¡± The Children Storytime occurs weekly during the school year.

Let us hope that real rhinos will be seen in the wild on our earth forever. We listened to a few stories with rhino characters but few authors use rhinos as central characters. Our nonfiction examples were a bit wordy for the preschool group but could definitely be enjoyed at home during story time with a parent. There is much to learn about these ancient animals.

With out you we wouldn't be able to put this program on. Also a big thanks to all the parents who get their kids, and some even the neighbors kids, to the park to participate. ""Over 30 years of studies consistently show that students who do not continue reading over the summer lose as much as 3 to 4 months of academic progress. This is especially true for low-income children. While children in higher-income families have access to books and participate in activities that support continued learning, children in low-income families have few books in the home and have restricted access to them. By the end of the sixth grade much of the achievement gap between high-income and low-income children can be attributed to loss of learning over the summer months. Some studies estimate that this gap can be as wide as three years."" From ¡°Summer Reading: Closing the Rich/Poor Achievement Gap,¡± by Richard L. Allington and Anne McGill-Franzen.

The past few weeks most discussions have settled on ""what are you going to be for Halloween""? The internet has been searched for costume ideas and plans have been made. I remember being that kid. Halloween was by far one of the most important days of the year. The anticipation of dressing up and roaming the streets for free candy consumed most of October. And the traditions have been passed along to the next generations. Yet I wonder as I listen to conversations, WHY? is Halloween changing for so many adults. I hear people laugh and say we sit in the house with our lights off or we leave for the night. Halloween has been pushed aside for some years as other events have taken the spotlight. However, this year is one of the few ( Perfect Halloweens) as it falls on a Saturday night. The trick or treaters have the night the weather is perfect and they have made their plans.

A cook in ancient China discovered that a mixture of sulphur, saltpetre, and charcoal was highly flammable and would explode if confined in a small space. This discovery was first used for entertainment. The technique was soon adapted to weaponry and used to shoot rocket-powered arrows. In the 7th century the knowledge spread west via Arabia, reaching Europe in the 13th century where pyrotechnics developed with the invention of the gun in the 14th century. It was not until the 19th century that fireworks became as vividly colourful as we know them today. Brilliant colours are achieved by combining potassium chlorate and various metallic salts. These salts produce a variety of colours: strontium burns red; copper makes blue; barium glows green; and sodium produces yellow. Magnesium, aluminium and titanium give off white sparkles or a flash. Every firework show is a fantastic display of physics. The pyrotechnist has to take into account the relationships between vectors, velocities, projectiles and their trajectories together with the explosion forces behind burst patterns.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Discovery, a collaboration with JCISD, is an after school enrichment program in science and math with hands-on experiments and activities. Discoverys mission is to reinforce what children learn in the classroom and foster a life-long love of learning. This session starts with a LEGO challenge. The theme this year is Waste Wise- learning to look at trash in a whole new way. The grant allows the library to offer free registration to all students in the 3rd-5th grades. The first day of Discovery is Sept. 15, and registration forms are available at the library. Heres an article by Mark Smith, the Director of TSLAC that talks about some of the other wonderful library programs across the state that were also funded. The projects funded by these grants are an amazing panorama of innovation, best practice, and forward direction in library service. The projects include initiatives that will reinforce the new model of libraries as learning centers such as 3-D Labs @ Your Library, a CTLS project to put 3-D printers at the core of a network of librarians sharing expertise for the benefit of patrons; or the Johnson City Public Library¡¯s Discovery Academy that will provide STEM learning opportunities for third to fifth-grade students.

1147,111,10,"BANNED BOOK: The Dairy of a Young Girl This one is a little sad. First, to be clear that the banned version of Anne Frank's writings is not the version depicted here, but the definitive edition. Why you ask? Because it adds about 30% more content that she left out of the original publication. What was added that was so offensive that it was challenged? There are passages she described her anatomy and changes to her body, which some deem as ""pornographic"". Frank had no resources to answer her questions about her physical changes and relied on her observations to answer them as best she could. One could argue that teenagers can relate with the confusing physical changes of puberty on top of stress from situations they do not fully control. Thus, it might behoove teenagers to read Frank's diary as it could possibly start a dialogue about their own anatomical questions. That is the beauty of literature. You can use someone's perspective to question and grow. Reason: ""Pornographic"" Passages",1,0,0,1,0,0,0
