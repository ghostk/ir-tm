AB In the field of complex social network hotspot analysis, mining the dynamic factors behind information propagation is a focus of current research. In this paper, user multidimensional attributes and evolutionary games are combined with the traditional susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model, which is used to quantify the impact of external and internal driving factors on group state transitions during hotspot propagation. First, the network structure attributes and historical attributes of social users are extracted, and user multidimensional attribute driven mechanism is constructed by multivariate linear regression. This is used to analyze the internal driving factors that affect users participating in hotspots. Second, taking into account multi-source information dissemination and the complexity of user interaction behaviors, the concept, perceived popularity, is defined, and the dynamic evolution strategy of user behaviors based on evolutionary game theory is proposed. This reveals that external driving factors affect the behaviors of social network users. Finally, considering the external and internal driving factors that affect hot topic information dissemination, we obtain the hotspot propagation model based on user multidimensional attributes and evolutionary games, combined with the traditional SIR epidemic model. Experiments show that the model can effectively reveal the impact of different driving factors on information dissemination, and depict the trend of information dissemination in social networks.

AB State-dependent time-delayed systems are more realistic delayed systems in nature and human society. Their dynamic problems are hot issues and difficult questions due to the fact that the classical RFDE theory is not suitable for them any more. And its corresponding rigorous theory is to be established. The study on the existence and stability of their periodic solutions is an important topic and a difficult question. Compound TCP is a widely used transport control protocol, and proportional integral enhanced (PIE) queue policy is an effective and simple queue policy in the Internet. Thus it is significant to study the dynamics and control of the compound TCP-PIE system. In this paper, Period-1 oscillations of the state-dependent delayed TCP models with PIE queue management policy are predicted by the high-dimensional harmonic balance method (HDHBM). Compared with the traditional harmonic balance method, HDHBM avoids the complex integration of the Fourier coefficients of the nonlinear right hand of the systems by solving the time domain variables of the Fourier coefficients at equally spaced sub-time over the period of one cycle of motion. Thus it transforms the problem into a relatively simple nonlinear algebraic equations, which greatly reduces the computation. By HDHBM, the approximate expressions of the Period-1 solutions for this state-dependent delayed compound TCP-PIE system are obtained. We compare their amplitudes and phase portraits with those of the DDE-BIFTOOL. They agree well with each other. It suggests the validity, effectiveness and simplicity of the employed method. It also turns out that many parameters of the state-dependent delayed TCP model with PIE queue management policy play a very important role in its dynamic behaviours. It follows that PIE parameter mu and update time T may play the most important roles in the Compound TCP-PIE congestion control model and packet loss probability p((t) over tilde) may dominate the dynamics and performances of the network. As a result, we should control the parameters in a proper range to achieve our desired network performances. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Degradation-based modeling methods have been recognized as an essential and effective approach for lifetime and remaining useful life (RUL) estimations for various health management activities that can be scheduled to ensure reliable, safe, and economical operation of deteriorating systems. As one of the most popular stochastic modeling methods, the previous several decades have witnessed remarkable developments and extensive applications of Wiener-process-based methods. However, there is no systematic review particularly focused on this topic. Therefore, this paper reviews recent modeling developments of the Wiener-process-based methods for degradation data analysis and RUL estimation, as well as their applications in the field of prognostics and health management (PHM). After a brief introduction of conventional Wiener-process-based degradation models, we pay particular attention to variants of the Wiener process by considering nonlinearity, multi-source variability, covariates, and multivariate involved in the degradation processes. In addition, we discuss the applications of the Wiener-process-based models for degradation test design and optimal decision-making activities such as inspection, condition-based maintenance (CBM), and replacement. Finally, we highlight several future challenges deserving further studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Many practical systems, such as thermal system, economic system and electric power system, can be more accurately described by the fractional-order system rather than integer-order system. Therefore, it is an important topic to study the fractional-order system and estimate its parameters. The problem of parameter estimation is essentially a multi-dimensional parameter optimization problem. In this paper, according to the average value of position information, an improved Tent mapping and a piecewise mutation probability, a modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) algorithm is presented to solve the parameter estimation problem. The performance of MPSO is tested with eight benchmark functions, which proves the effectiveness of the algorithm. Based on the double-dispersion Cole model, the proposed MPSO algorithm is used to estimate the parameters for the generated simulated datasets. Experimental results show that the MPSO algorithm for parameters identification of the Cole model is an effective and promising method with high accuracy and good robustness.

AB For text content retrieval, the user can easily scan through and select from a list of retrieved items. This is impossible for spoken content retrieval, because the retrieved items are not easily displayed on-screen. In addition, due to the high degree of uncertainty for speech recognition, retrieval results can he very noisy. One way to counter such difficulties is through user-machine interaction. The machine can take different actions to interact with the user to obtain better retrieval results before showing them to the user. For example, the machine can request extra information from the user, return a list of topics for the user to select from, and so on. In this paper, we propose using deep-Q-network (DQN) to determine the machine actions for interactive spoken content retrieval. DQN bypasses the need to estimate hand-crafted states, and directly determines the best action based on the present retrieval results even without any human knowledge. It is shown to achieve significantly better performance as compared with the previous hand-crafted states. We further find that double DQN and dueling DQN improve the naive version.

AB Liver segmentation and volumetry in native MR-volume data is an important topic in epidemiological research. Manual liver segmentation is extremely time-consuming and often infeasible requiring automatized methods. Automatic liver segmentation is challenging because of the large variability in liver shape and appearance and the low contrast to neighboring organs. We present a fully automatized liver segmentation framework that uses a sequence of modules based on individualized model knowledge on liver appearance and shape. Liver probability maps are computed that incorporate organ-specific features like MR-intensity distributions, inner-organ MR-differences and liver positions. Probability map generation differentiates automatically between fatty and non-fatty livers. Moreover, we improve an existing technique for prior shape level set segmentation to delineate the liver in tissue-specific liver probability maps and to recognize cystic hepatic tissue. Dice coefficients of 0.937 and low volumetric errors on 35 test data sets confirm the robust segmentation quality of the framework. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The growing need for low-latency access to computing resources has motivated the introduction of edge computing, where resources are strategically placed at the access networks. Unfortunately, edge computing infrastructures like fogs and cloudlets have limited scalability and may be prohibitively expensive to install given the vast edge of the Internet. In this paper, we present Opportunistic Edge Computing (OEC), a new computing paradigm that provides a framework to create scalable infrastructures at the edge using end-user contributed resources. One of the goals of OEC is to place resources where there is high demand for them by incentivizing people to share their resources. This paper defines the OEC paradigm and the involved stakeholders and puts forward a management framework to build, manage and monitor scalable edge infrastructures. It also highlights the key differences between the OEC computing models and the existing computing models and shed the light on early works on the topic. The paper also presents preliminary experimental results that highlight the benefits and the limitations of OEC compared to the regular cloud computing deployment and the Fog deployment. It finally summarizes key research directions pertaining to resource management in OEC environments. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Quantum technology is increasingly relying on specialised statistical inference methods for analysing quantum measurement data. This motivates the development of "quantum statistics", a field that is shaping up at the overlap of quantum physics and "classical" statistics. One of the less investigated topics to date is that of statistical inference for infinite dimensional quantum systems, which can be seen as quantum counterpart of nonparametric statistics. In this paper, we analyse the asymptotic theory of quantum statistical models consisting of ensembles of quantum systems which are identically prepared in a pure state. In the limit of large ensembles, we establish the local asymptotic equivalence (LAE) of this i.i.d. model to a quantum Gaussian white noise model. We use the LAE result in order to establish minimax rates for the estimation of pure states belonging to Hermite Sobolev classes of wave functions. Moreover, for quadratic functional estimation of the same states we note an elbow effect in the rates, whereas for testing a pure state a sharp parametric rate is attained over the nonparametric Hermite Sobolev class.

AB The quality of any text mining technique is highly dependent on the features that are used to represent the document collection. A classical form of document representation is the vector space model (VSM), according to which the documents are represented as vectors of weights that correspond to the features of the documents. The bag-of-words model is the most popular VSM approach due to its simplicity and general applicability, but this model does not include term dependency and has a high dimensionality. In the literature, several models for document representation have been proposed in order to capture the dependency of terms. Among them, the topic model representation is one of the most interesting approaches - since it describes the collection of documents in a way that reveals their internal structure and the interrelationships therein, and also provides a dimensionality reduction. However, even for topic models, the efficient extraction of information concerning the relations among terms for document representation is still a major research challenge. In order to address this issue, we proposed thelatent association rule cluster based model (LARCM). The LARCM is a non-probabilistic topic model that makes use of association rule clustering to build a document representation with low dimensionality in such a way that each feature (i.e., topic) is comprised of information concerning relations among the terms. We evaluated the interpretability of the topics obtained by using our proposed model against the ones provided by the traditional latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) model and the LDA model using a document representation that includes correlated terms (i.e., bag-of-related-words). The experimental results indicated that the LARCM provides topics with better interpretability than the LDA models. Additionally, we used the topics obtained by the LARCM in two different applications: text classification and page recommendation. With respect to text classification, the topics were used to improve document collection representation. Concerning page recommendation, topics were used as contextual information in context aware recommender systems. Results have shown that the topics provided by the LARCM can be used to improve both applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Prognostics plays a vital part in modern decision making for maintenance. Many related valuable approaches have been reported by scientists with both truncated and failure histories. However, for cases where the actual asserts have no failure histories, one important topic of prognostics is to focus on modeling with only truncated histories. Here we first describe an algorithm called time-continuous relevant isometric mapping (TRIM) to establish a manifold space where the health state evolutionary laws within truncated histories can be cognized. Unlike classical methods, such as isometric feature mapping, TRIM involves the vital element of state evolution (time), establishes a state evolutionary manifold space by utilizing both local geometrical structures and global isometric features of a given truncated data set. Meantime, two geometrical metrics, neighborhood geodesic distance (NGD) and cumulative geodesic distance, were defined and used in this study to indicate the health state of a given component. Then the feed-forward neural network (FFNN) was trained with inputs from the NGD series. The corresponding target vectors (survival probabilities) of FFNN were estimated by intelligent product limit estimator using truncation times and generated failure times. After validation, the FFNN was applied to predict the machine component health of individual component. To validate the proposed method, case study was conducted by using the degradation data generated by a bearing test rig. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can highlight the intrinsic health state evolutionary laws by TRIM even with only truncated histories. The more accuracy prognostics results can be consequently achieved based on the cognition of the evolutionary laws. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Well-being as an intangible, philosophical, and multi-faceted phenomenon is hard to measure. By taking a psycholinguistic expression of well-being, we measure how tourists' experiencing holiday destinations affects their well-being states. The well-being state includes increases or decreases in Hedonia and Eudaimonia as a result of destination experiences. We apply text topic modelling to analyse big Web 2.0 datasets. These include tourists' self-reports of their experiences during their visit to destination countries collected from Travelblog.org weblog. The findings from a Global sample, New Zealand, and France are compared to generalise Hedonia and Eudaimonia conceptualisations across these destinations. The outputs also characterise experiences with maximum well-being and ill-being that include both Hedonia and Eudaimonia. Managerial implications include how a destination image may be managed according to desired well-being states. This also helps tourists make informed decisions about their holiday destinations.

AB One of the features that should be considered when designing a thermal energy storage (TES) system is its behaviour when subjected to non-continuous (partial loads) operating conditions. Indeed, the system performance can be sensibly affected by the partial charging and discharging processes. This topic is analysed in the present study by means of a two-dimensional axisymmetric numerical model implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics. A latent heat TES system consisting of a vertical concentric tube heat exchanger is simulated to investigate the effect of different partial load operating conditions on the system behaviour.
   The effects of different heat transfer distributions and evolutions of the solid-liquid interface, are evaluated to identify the optimal management criteria of the TES systems. The results showed that partial load strategies allow to achieve a substantial reduction in the duration of the TES (up to 50%) process against a small decrease in stored energy (up 30%). The close correlation between the energy and the duration of the TES cycle is also evaluated during the discharge using detailed maps related to the melting fraction. These maps allow for the evaluation of the most efficient load conditions considering both charging and discharging processes to satisfy a specific energy demand. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI STATUTORY DESIGN AS POLICY ANALYSIS

DT Article
ID MULTIDIMENSIONAL VOTING MODELS; FOREIGN-AFFAIRS; ADMINISTRATIVE STATE;
   LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; UNITED-STATES; POWER;
   CONSTITUTION; LESSONS; ACT
AB Statutes dominate our legal system, but we have no theory about the best way to design them. The process that the U.S. Congress follows is haphazard and obscure. Any member can introduce a bill. There are no requirements about who can draft the bill or how the basic decisions that it embodies should be made. The one requirement is that the bill must be written in statutory language, in a form that appears ready for enactment. This means that all the basic decisions about the bill's design have been reached by the time the bill is introduced, and before it is subjected to any scrutiny by elected representatives or the general public. Any changes that the members of Congress want to make, if the bill goes forward, must be done through the revision process and on an incremental basis.
   This Article suggests a more systematic way to design legislation. Based on modern policy analysis, it proposes that the legislative process begin with a statement of a problem to he solved. Congressional committees would begin by analyzing the problem and generating a range of potential solutions. Drafts of proposed statutory language would only he considered at that point. A process of this sort is more likely to generate legislation that serves its basic purpose, which is to produce the results that the members who vote on it desire. Either House of Congress, or any individual chamber of a state legislature, could implement this approach without the approval of any other body, and without any significant change in its other practices or basic structure. The proposal, moreover, is nonpartisan, since members of either party will want to achieve their own purposes more effectively and reliably.
   This Article proposes that Congress and American state legislatures adopt a new method for designing statutes. At present, the process almost always begins with a written draft that is, a document phrased in statutory language that could be adopted as it stands. This Article's proposal, derived from the modern theory of policy analysis, is that legislatures begin with a statement of the problem that is being addressed. This statement, and not a draft of a proposed statute, would he the subject of the first set of hearings held by the relevant legislative committee or committees. Only after these hearings had been held, and a range of alternative statutory solutions presented to the committee, would the committee consider any document written in statutory language.
   The underlying issue that this proposal addresses is the quality of statutory enactments-that is, their ability to achieve their desired purpose. There can be no question about the importance of the issue. As Guido Calabresi has observed, we live in the "age of statutes. "(1) Statutes are the most important component of our modern legal system; for at least a century, they have determined the basic content of our law. Common law, or judge-made law, continues to govern some areas of private relations, and the President can exercise limited domestic authority through executive order. In the domestic area, however, the law by which we govern ourselves and attempt to shape our future is statutory.(2)
   But we have no theory, and a very limited academic discourse, about the best way to design statutes.(3) Worse still, even suggesting that this topic should be the subject of academic discussion violates a norm of modern scholarship. It is considered pointless or incoherent to address recommendations to legislatures about ways to improve their procedures.(4) Legal scholars regularly frame recommendations to courts about the best way to decide cases in general, in addition to the best answer to particular issues.(5) Policy analysts and political scientists offer recommendations to executive agents regarding their general decisionmaking strategy, as well as their resolution of specific problems. But few scholars,in these disciplines or any other, address similarly normative arguments to legislatures, the primary statute-making institution in the American system of governance,7 about the way to structure the legislative process so that it produces effective statutes.
   The legislative process has been extensively studied of course, but the great bulk of the work tends to be descriptive. With the exception of two recent articles that draw salutary attention to the drafting process and serve as the starting point for the present Article, one by Victoria Nourse and Jane Schacter and the other by Abbe Gluck and Lisa Bressman,(8) legal and political science scholarship devotes little attention to the actual language of statutes, as opposed to the politics of their enactment.(9) There are, to he sure, a relatively small number of books and articles that provide advice or instruction about the way to draft statutory language.(1) A notable feature of this limited literature is that it is addressed to a hypothesized drafting expert a policy analyst who is envisioned as drafting a statute that will subsequently be submitted to a legislature and not to the legislature itself(11) In fact, as David Marcello observes, the underlying assumption of this work is that the drafter is an abstract entity, a value-neutral technician who simply translates her client's instructions into statutory language.(12) A somewhat larger body of scholarly literature addresses expert organizations, most notably the American Law Institute ("ALI") and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws ("NCCUSL"), that draft uniform statutes for submission to state legislatures.(13) Because this literature is addressed to an expert body, however, it pays virtually no attention to the state legislatures that must ultimately enact the statutes that the ALI and NCCUSL design. Finally, there are some articles that propose a new statute or the improvement of an existing one.(14) Although these would appear to he addressed to legislators, they often seem to be general policy recommendations cast in statutory terms for the sake of concreteness or precision.
   An obvious explanation for this academic norm, and for the lacuna that it inevitably produces, is that scholars regard legislators as motivated by exclusively political considerations, specifically the desire to be reelected.(15) To be sure, empirical studies of actual legislators often conclude that they are motivated by ideology, which can be regarded as their idea about what is best for the nation.(16) But the scholars who conduct these studies do not act on this conclusion that is, they do not proceed to address legislators as rational decisionmakers and recommend ideas that would make their work product more effective.(17) What makes this omission even more remarkable is that scholars, as just noted, do not adopt this same approach to other government officials. That is not because they are so naive as to assert that judges and executive agents are selfless servants of the public who are never motivated by individual selfinterest.(18) The premise of normative scholarship, rather, is that public officials act from a mixture of personal and public-regarding motivations. Thus, the working assumption is that these officials will be receptive to recommendations about the best way to serve the public, and their decision-making will benefit from such recommendations, even if their motivations are mixed, or if they sometimes consider only their own personal advantage. Why then are scholars unwilling to take the same, seemingly reasonable approach to legislators, particularly when empirical evidence supports that approach?
   The issue becomes more urgent when one considers the had repute from which our national legislature currently suffers.(19) To some extent, this is irremediable; a legislature is, by design, an arena of political conflict, and people generally find conflict distressing.(20) But at least part of the overwhelming public dissatisfaction regarding Congress seems to stem from the sense that it is disorganized and chaotic, that it is unable to manage conflict in a systematic way and produce desirable results.(21) The tendency to treat the members of Congress as immune to rational discourse probably contributes to this popular belief. While the average citizen is not reading legal and political science literature, this liter ature does affect the general public discourse, and perhaps even the legislators' views about their own institution.(22) Certainly, a complete absence of scholarly discussion about ways that Congress can function more effectively can only exacerbate the general view that it cannot function at all.
   I have written previously about the possible reasons for this scholarly lacuna;23 the purpose of this Article is to counteract it by proposing a new methodology for the design of legislation. Part I describes the existing methodology, as employed by the U.S. Congress, and identifies the underlying premise of the methodology, which is that legislative drafting is a process of political argument. Part II suggests that a different methodology could be derived from the idea that legislation in the modern state is in fact a form of public policymaking. In Part III, the existing methodology is critiqued from a policymaking perspective. Part IV then proposes a new methodology for drafting legislation on the basis of the policymaking model described in Part II and the problem with the existing methodology described in Part III. Finally, Part V discusses the range of legislation to which the proposal would apply, and argues that there would be no serious impediments to its implementation.

DT Article
DE American saints; relics; material religion; catacomb martyrs; St.
   Vibiana; St. Victoria; Catholic revivalism
AB The veneration of relics of the saints in U.S. Catholic history is a muchneglected topic. Partly because scholars are often uncomfortable with aspects of material religion, but also given that relics are, in the narrowest sense, remains of the dead, relics are too often assumed to be lifeless objects or the focus of a 'primitive' piety. Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, popes such as Pius IX gifted the entire bodily remains of newly discovered early Christian martyrs from the ancient Roman catacombs to priests and bishops of the young United States. Likely inspired by the phenomenally successful international cultus of catacomb martyr St. Philomena, Spanish and German-born clergy stationed in America modeled devotion to these saints and their relics. This phenomenon, and the promotion of "Roman"-style relic veneration in general, is an aspect of a Catholic religious revivalism often missing from American religious historiography. The largely foreignborn population of nineteenth and early-twentieth century American Catholic faithful, who at the time had no native American saints of their own to venerate, welcomed the presence of these "immigrant" saints into both their public and private devotional spaces. In order to demonstrate the pan-American importance of relics in this period, this article focuses on the shrines of St. Vibiana (Anglo-Spanish California) and St. Victoria (German-American Midwest).

AB Recent developments in modern agri-food markets have called into question the predictive capability of the traditional models and tools used by agricultural economists to assess and measure market power. As a result, agricultural economists are on a quest for novel methods and approaches that surpass the traditional market power construct. In this article, we present an essential overview of the evolution of the literature concerning power relationships in agrifood value chains. The goal of this review is to emphasize recent conceptual and empirical approaches, as well as highlight topics of interest that are likely to shape the direction of future analyses of market power and bargaining in the agrifood sector.

TI Building Scalable Business Models
SO MIT SLOAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Business model innovation has become a hot topic in management circles, and understandably so. No management activity is more important than having clarity about how the organization creates, delivers, and captures value. It requires, among other things, knowing what customers want, how value can be best delivered, and how to enlist strategic partners to achieve maximum benefit.
   Although the ability to develop strong value propositions can enable companies to "get by," the authors argue that many of today's most successful businesses are those that can place themselves in the "sweet spot" of business model scalability. If managers are incapable of factoring scalability attributes into their business model design, they risk being left behind, much the way bookstores owned by Borders Group Inc. were eclipsed by Amazon.com Inc.
   In the course of their research, the authors identified five patterns by which companies can achieve scalability. The first pattern involves adding new distribution channels. The second entails freeing the business from traditional capacity constraints. The third involves outsourcing capital investments to partners that, in effect, became participants in the business model. The fourth is having customers and other partners assume multiple roles in the business model. And the fifth pattern is to establish platform models in which even competitors may become customers. Based on these patterns, the authors developed a framework for identifying potential levers for business model scalability along with a road map that managers can use to improve their business models.
   Over and above the need to create value propositions that are difficult for competitors to replicate, managers need to develop business models that are capable of achieving positive returns and accelerating returns on the investments made. Merely identifying synergies, the authors note, doesn't necessarily lead to improvements in business model scalability. They write: "To achieve scalability, managers and entrepreneurs need to remove capacity constraints. They have opportunities to do this in a variety of ways: by collaborating with partners; by encouraging partners to play multiple roles in the business model; by creating platforms to attract new partners; or even by working with current competitors."

AB Feature reduction is nowadays an important topic in machine learning as it reduces the complexity of the final model and makes it easier to interpret. In some applications, the features arise from multiple sources and it is not so important to select the individual features as to select the important sources. This leads to a group feature selection problem. In this paper, we consider the group feature selection in the multiclass classification setting based on the framework of support vector machines. We reformulate it as a sparse problem by prescribing the maximum number of active groups and propose a novel method based on the ADMM algorithm. We proposed the method in such a way that the main computational load is performed in the first iteration and the remaining iterations can be computed fast. This allows us to handle large problems. We demonstrate the good performance of our method on several real-world datasets. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We consider incorporating topic information into message-response matching to boost responses with rich content in retrieval-based chatbots. To this end, we propose a topic aware attentive recurrent neural network in which representations of the message and the response are enhanced by the topic information. The model first leverages the message and the response represented by recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to weight topic words given by a pre-trained LDA model and forms topic vectors as linear combinations of the topic words. It then refines the representations of the message and the response with the topic vectors through an attention mechanism. The attention mechanism weights the hidden sequences of the message and the response not only by themselves but also by their topic vectors. Thus both the parts that are important to matching and the parts that are semantically related to the topics are highlighted in the representations.Empirical studies on public data and human annotated data show that our model can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods and rank more responses with rich content in high positions.

AB This paper presents a computationally efficient finite element analysis of the heat generation in ultrasonic welding (USW). The temperature field is predicted from a continuous thermal model, with the heat generation rate being calculated intermittently, using a deformation model for single cycles of oscillation. The model was applied to USW of Al 6111 to itself, and to DC04 steel and Ti6Al4V, with plastic deformation only occurring in the Al alloy. Ultrasonic softening was allowed for empirically in the constitutive plastic response of the Al alloy. The predicted heat generation rate for all three material combinations was consistent with that inferred from thermocouple data and the thermal model. Material deformation maps were developed as a means of illustrating the dominant deformation regime of temperature and strain-rate. The thermal and deformation models were then fully coupled, as a proof of concept, to demonstrate that the power and temperature histories can be predicted directly from the constitutive data for the alloy and a kinematic description of the process.

AB Revealing structural features of the amorphous precursor of zeolite is an important research topic for elucidating formation mechanism of zeolites. To understand the zeolite precursor's comprehensive structural features, this study compared the precursor with the glass possessing similar compositions. By combining the high-energy Xray total scattering method, Na-23-MQ-MAS-NMR, and reverse Monte Carlo simulation, we revealed structural differences among FAU-type zeolites, their precursors, and glass with similar compositions. As for crystallization behavior of FAU-type zeolite, pair distribution function and NMR analyses revealed that the environment of Na became gradually ordered during the crystallization. In addition, relaxation of large aluminosilicate rings was also confirmed. Comparison of the zeolite precursor and the glass clarified differences in Na-O distances and ring distributions, and simulation modeling supported these insights.

AB Payment card fraud leads to heavy annual financial losses around the world, thus giving rise to the need for improvements to the fraud detection systems used by banks and financial institutions. In the academe, as well, payment card fraud detection has become an important research topic in recent years. With these considerations in mind, we developed a method that involves two stages of detecting fraudulent payment card transactions. The extraction of suitable transactional features is one of the key issues in constructing an effective fraud detection model. In this method, additional transaction features are derived from primary transactional data. A better understanding of cardholders' spending behaviors is created by these features. After which the first stage of detection is initiated. A cardholder's spending behaviors vary over time so that new behavior of a cardholder is closer to his/her recent behaviors. Accordingly, a new similarity measure is established on the basis of transaction time in this stage. This measure assigns greater weight to recent transactions. In the second stage, the dynamic random forest algorithm is employed for the first time in initial detection, and the minimum risk model is applied in cost-sensitive detection. We tested the proposed method on a real transactional dataset obtained from a private bank. The results showed that the recent behavior of cardholders exerts a considerable effect on decision-making regarding the evaluation of transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. The findings also indicated that using both primary and derived transactional features increases the F-measure. Finally, an average 23% increase in prevention of damage (PoD) is achieved with the proposed cost-sensitive approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Automatically recommending suitable tags for online content is a necessary task for better information organization and retrieval. In this article, we propose a generative model SIMWORD for the tag recommendation problem on textual content. The key observation of our model is that the tags and their relevant/similar words may have appeared in the corresponding content. In particular, we first empirically verify this observation in real data sets, and then design a supervised topic model which is guided by the above observation for tag recommendation. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several existing methods in terms of recommendation accuracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FACE-RECOGNITION; ALGORITHMS
AB Dimensionality reduction as one of most attractive topics in machine learning research area has aroused extensive attentions in recent years. In order to preserve the local structure of data, most of dimensionality reduction methods consider constructing the relationships among each sample and its k nearest neighbors, and they find the neighbors in original space by using Euclidean distance. Since the data in original space contain some noises and redundant features, finding the neighbors in original space is incorrect and may degrade the subsequent performance. Therefore, how to find the optimal k nearest neighbors for each sample is the key point to improve the robustness of model. In this paper, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction method, named Adaptive Neighborhood MinMax Projections (AN-MMP) which finds the neighbors in the optimal subspace by solving Trace Ratio problem in which the noises and redundant features have been removed already. Meanwhile, the samples within same class are pulled together while the samples between different classes are pushed far away in such learned subspace. Besides, proposed model is a general approach which can be implemented easily and applied on other methods to improve the robustness. Extensive experiments conducted on several synthetic data and real-world data sets and achieve some encouraging performance with comparison to metric learning and feature extraction methods, which demonstrates the efficiency of our method.

TI Failure Mechanism of Highly Stressed Rock Mass during Unloading Based on

AB During excavation unloading, highly stressed rock masses at great depth exhibit failure modes with different scales, for instance, zonal disintegration, rockbursts, and super-low friction. The root cause of the failure mechanisms of highly stressed rock masses differs. In recent years, research on the failure mechanism of highly stressed rock masses during unloading has become a frontier topic in geotechnical engineering. This paper relies on the deep mining process laboratory of the China Hongtoushan Copper Mine, where it has been observed that the deep rock unloading process causes macroscopic deformation and opens microscopic joints in deep rock. Analysis of monitoring data has shown that compressional deformation occurs in the surrounding rock masses subjected to unloading during mining. It has also verified the engineering phenomenon of local compression in rockbolts. Test materials similar to deep rock were used to simulate the unloading process of in situ rock mass and verify the physical phenomenon of shrinkage of the rock mass in the unloading area. Based on this phenomenon, the stress arch theory for rock mass failure mode has been established. Finally, numerical simulation analysis of the influence of different radii of the curvature fissures in surrounding rock and the displacement field distribution of the stress field was used to verify the stress arch theory for the failure mechanism of highly stressed rock mass during unloading.

AB Bats are major consumers of arthropods, and there is ever growing evidence that they play a pivotal role in the fight against agricultural pests. However, relatively little research has addressed explicitly this important topic, and studies in temperate regions (especially European case studies) are infrequent. In the last few years, state-ofart molecular methods to identify prey remains in droppings and new experimental approaches to assess the actual magnitude of this ecosystem service have opened new perspectives in research. In this review, we discuss such aspects with an emphasis on temperate regions, and identify new research frontiers. These comprise: (1) detecting new bat species that consume pests, and further pest insects that bats might eat; (2) exploring sublethal effects of bat echolocation calls on tympanate moth pests; (3) getting a better understanding of bat predation over blood-sucking arthropods that parasitize livestock; (4) unveiling indirect effects of bat predation on plant pathogens; (5) implementing models to map the occurrence of bat insectivory and the potential to promote it; and (6) analyse bat droppings for active surveillance of arthropod pests and the diseases they carry. We also highlight that so-called "common" bat species, often neglected in conservation actions, are likely to provide the bulk of pest suppression in agroecosystems. All such aspects merit investigation and may lead to novel management practices aimed at conjugating bat conservation with economic and social sustainability of farming.

AB Horizontal directional drilling (HDD) plays an important role in pipeline construction. Drilling mud loss, or the maximum allowable drilling mud pressure, in soil and sand layers during HDD has been continuously studied since the 1980s. However, because HDD has been used more often in bedrock, it was realized that there is a lack of studies on this topic for rock HDD projects. In this study, the drilling mud loss risk of a HDD pipeline construction project in competent soft bedrock is studied by numerical modeling. The numerical modeling result shows that, in bedrock, the Delft equation can overestimate the maximum allowable drilling mud pressure when the lateral earth pressure coefficient is less than unity. Through numerical modeling, it is found that tension failure, instead of shear failure, is the main failure mode of bedrock surrounding the borehole. The failure mode in this project looks more like fracturing after expansion, instead of cylindrical expansion. A parametric study is conducted to investigate the required minimum rock mass overburden thickness, effect of overburden stress, and effect of geological strength index (GSI) value.

AB Computer vision-based fire detection is one of the crucial tasks in modern surveillance system. In recent years, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has become an active topic because of its high accuracy recognition rate in a wide range of applications. How to reliably and effectively solve the problems of flame detection, however, has still been a challenging problem in practice. In this paper, we proposed a novel flame detection algorithm based on CNN in real time by processing the video data generated by an ordinary camera monitoring a scene. Firstly, to improve the efficiency of recognition, a candidate target area extraction algorithm is proposed for dealing with the suspected flame area. Secondly, the extracted feature maps of candidate areas are classified by the designed deep neural network model based on CNN. Finally, the corresponding alarm signal is obtained by the classification results. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively identify fire and achieve higher alarm rate in the homemade database. The proposed method can effectively realize the real-time performance of fire warning in practice.

AB Coupling pressure management and energy recovery in water distribution networks (WDNs) is an appealing topic in the field of optimal management of water systems. The use of turbines or pumps as turbines (PATs) allows for reducing leakage within the network while also recovering energy that would otherwise dissipate, by means of pressure reducing valves (PRVs). Unlike water supply systems, where operating conditions remain essentially constant over time, a real-time control (RTC) is required in WDNs because of the variability of pressure and flow discharge during the day. To this end, a prototype for RTC of a WDN was presented and discussed in a recent paper, in which constant rotational speed of the impeller was considered. To overcome such a limitation and maximize energy recovery, an inverter was coupled to the prototype. A mathematical model of the prototype was developed and the decision variables were calculated by solving an optimization problem via the YALMIP tool of MATLAB at varying conditions of inflow discharge, pressure head at the inlet, and desired pressure head at the control node. The mathematical model was further validated through preliminary laboratory experiments, showing good agreement between simulated and actual values.

AB Insufficient information captured by a single satellite sensor can hardly be fit real applications. Pansharpening is a hot topic in remote sensing region, which combines the spectral information of multispectral image and spatial details of panchromatic image to obtain high spatial resolution multispectral image. In this paper, we present a novel sparse representation-based pansharpening method, which consists three stages: dictionary construction, panchromatic image decomposition, and high spatial resolution multispectral image reconstruction. First, we use multispectral images as training set and calculate intensity channels of multispectral images. Then we obtain the high-frequency components and low frequency components of intensity channels. Second, we sparsely decompose the panchromatic image by using a pair of dictionaries to obtain high-frequency components and low-frequency components of the panchromatic image. Third, the optimized high-frequency components of the panchromatic image will be integrated into the multispectral image to generate the final high resolution multispectral image. The quantitative and subjective evaluations show that the proposed method performs better effectiveness and practicality than the existing sparse representation-based methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Android security is an ongoing topic of interest to both the research community and industry, particularly as the mobile threat landscape evolves. A threat that has yet to be resolved is malicious link dissemination via QR codes, and such codes are widely used by mobile users in countries such as China. Thus, this paper proposes a threat-oriented QR malicious link detection framework, QRFence, based on a novel machine learning-based link threat-degree evaluation model. Specifically, QRFence comprises a QR malicious link detection scheme and an integrated permission detection scheme, and provides the following properties: multiple classification algorithms, extensive training features and various permission combinations. The proposed framework is independent of the security detection plugin, and performs threat evaluation on the QR links during decoding; therefore, allowing users to understand potential threats of malicious links on-the-fly. Findings from our evaluations indicate that the average accuracy rate of this proposed QR link detection framework is 93.20%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper provides an update on the neural control of bipedal walking in relation to bioinspired models and robots. It is argued that most current models or robots are based on the construct of a symmetrical central pattern generator (CPG). However, new evidence suggests that CPG functioning is basically asymmetrical with its flexor half linked more tightly to the rhythm generator. The stability of bipedal gait, which is an important problem for robots and biological systems, is also addressed. While it is not possible to determine how biological biped systems guarantee stability, robot solutions can be useful to propose new hypotheses for biology. In the second part of this review, the focus is on gait perturbations, which is an important topic in robotics in view of the frequent falls of robots when faced with perturbations. From the human physiology it is known that the initial reaction often consists of a brief interruption followed by an adequate response. For instance, the successful recovery from a trip is achieved using some basic reactions (termed elevating and lowering strategies), that depend on the phase of the step cycle of the trip occurrence. Reactions to stepping unexpectedly in a hole depend on comparing expected and real feedback. Implementation of these ideas in models and robotics starts to emerge, with the most advanced robots being able to learn how to fall safely and how to deal with complicated disturbances such as provided by walking on a split-belt.

AB In this paper, a shell based finite element (FE) model previously introduced for capturing the face-on impact and compressive strength after impact (CSAI) response of composite laminated structures is evaluated for predicting the dynamic response and damage due to edge-on impact and the resulting CSAI. The model utilizes an in-plane progressive damage and failure material model, Enhanced Schapery Theory (EST), for modeling the full field damage and failure of a single lamina in the 1-2 plane. The material model captures the pre-peak matrix non-linearity due to micro cracking using Schapery Theory (ST). The Bazant-Oh Crack Band (CB) model is utilized for matrix cracking and fiber rupture at the lamina level. Discrete cohesive elements are used for delamination initiation and propagation. Edge-on impact data for a range of impact energies is used for evaluating the models capability. The predicted impact damage state of the laminate is used for acquiring predictions of the CSAI of the laminate. The model predictions show promising results for the impact and CSAI response of an edge-on impacted coupon. The paper discusses the strengths of the model, the issues encountered, as well as topics for future study.

AB Web personalization has been widely adopted in the mobile shopping context to improve shopping experience and consumer loyalty. Timing is a crucial issue of the implementation of web personalization, a topic not yet adequately investigated in the extant literature. Web personalization could classify into two forms, namely Before-search Web Personalization (BSWP) and After-search Web Personalization (ASWP), in the mobile shopping context. Besides, motivations are the critical factors in mobile shopping, and seldom research has studied the effects of motivation on consumer's use of web personalization in the mobile shopping context. To advance understanding of the timing issue of web personalization, this paper employs the Uses and Gratifications method to investigate how mobile shopping motivations influence consumers' use of BSWP and ASWP, respectively. Furthermore, this paper also investigates the role of an important personal disposition (i.e. need for cognition). Empirical results indicate that shopping motivations could have significant effects on web personalization use; furthermore, BSWP use and ASWP use are predicted by different shopping motivations. Besides, need for cognition is found to positively moderate some effects of mobile shopping motivations on web personalization use. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.

AB Free convection of alumina-water nanofluid in a tilted open cavity with a heat-generating solid element has been studied. The considered topic allows understanding an opportunity of nanofluids for cooling of the heat-generating elements in open cavities. Upper border is supposed to be open where nanofluid penetrates into the cavity. Simulation has been performed using the Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations formulated in non-dimensional stream function, vorticity and temperature. Finite difference method of the second order accuracy has been applied. The effects of cavity inclination angle (0 <= gamma <= pi/2), heater location (0.1 <= 8 <= 0.7, where delta is the dimensionless distance between the heater and left wall) and nanoparlicles volume fraction (0 <= phi <= 0.04) have been analyzed. It has been found that the considered parameters allow minimizing average heater temperature. The cavity inclination angle of pi/3 characterizes the heat transfer enhancement (average Nusselt number has the maximum value), while the heater average temperature has the minimum value. At the same time, a proximity of the heater to the cavity wall characterizes non-essential cooling of the heat-generating element. The most effective cooling of the heat-generating element occurs for central heater location with cavity inclination angle of pi/3. The considered alumina-water nanoparticles do not allow to intensify the cooling process for the heater element. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a novel single-image super-resolution (SR) approach based on latent topics in order to take advantage of the semantics pervading the topic space when super-resolving images. Image semantics has shown to be useful to relieve the ill-posed nature of the SR problem, however the most accepted clustering-based approach used to define semantic concepts limits the capability of representing complex visual relationships. The proposed approach provides a new probabilistic perspective where the SR process is performed according to the semantics encapsulated by a new topic model, the Sparse Multi-modal probabilistic latent Semantic Analysis (sMpLSA). Firstly, the sMpLSA model is formulated. Subsequently, a new SR framework based on sMpLSA is defined. Finally, an experimental comparison is conducted using seven learning-based SR methods over three different image datasets. Experiments reveal the potential of latent topics in SR by reporting that the proposed approach is able to provide a competitive performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Diffusion process is a hot topic in various subjects. However, much existing literature ignores the dynamic influence of the environment on the diffusion process and the impact of the diffusion process on the environment. Taking the IoT diffusion process in the e-commerce industry as example, we investigate the dynamic interaction between the IoT diffusion process and the external environment, i.e., the adjustment of retail prices and the profit of an online retailer through a simulation model. The simulation model combines the price adjustment mechanism and the diffusion evolution mechanism. We obtain two main conclusions. First, price adjustment of retailers blocks the loT diffusion process, and a higher online shopping disutility level could amplify the impediment influence of price adjustment. Second, the IoT diffusion is of influence on the pricing and profit of the online retailers. The influence type (i.e., positive or neglect, monotonous or non-monotonous) depends on the special circumstance. Under some conditions, a wider diffusion does not inevitably result in a larger profit of the online retailer. This shows us that a wider or faster diffusion is not always better.

By replacing the features in which a high degree of consensus is achieved by new ones, we address here an essential ingredient of societies: the evolution of topics as a result of social dynamics and debate. Our results show that, once cultural clusters have been formed, the introduction of new topics into the social debate has little effect on them, but it does have a significant influence on the cultural overlap. Along with the Monte Carlo simulations, we derive and numerically solve an equation for the stationary cultural overlap based on a mean-field approach which reproduces the qualitative behavior of the model.

AB Variable speed limits (VSL) strategies have been demonstrated to successfully improve traffic dynamics characteristics. However, the effects of the strategies on overall traffic performance from the perspective of Kerner's three-phase theory has yet to be needed. This paper attempts to present a comprehensive simulation study on this topic. The study investigates the effects of VSL strategies on traffic operation characteristics and environmental impacts by combining the Kerner-Klenov car-following model and a practical VSL control algorithm. Simulations have been carried out for different control scenarios. The simulation results quantitatively indicate how and to what extent the VSL strategies affect overall traffic performance, including fundamental diagram, local speed variance, VSP distributions and average exhaust emission rates. It is revealed that the implemented VSL strategies cannot either improve maximum flow rate or prevent from the occurrence of the FMS transition. However, VSL lead to a significant extension of occupancy range for synchronized flow phase and suppress speed variability in traffic stream in congested traffic state, especially in the jam phase and the transitional state S -> J. Moreover, the VSL strategies is able to reduce traffic emissions by improving VSP distributions and average emission rates in the synchronized and jam phases. These findings suggest that the perspective of Kerner's three-phase theory can be added to the development of VSL control algorithms which aim to achieve high traffic efficiency with minimum traffic environmental impacts.

AB Nowadays, the memory effect of drivers' behavior has been a hot topic in traffic flow research. In this paper, based on the lattice hydrodynamic model a new feedback control model is derived in a single-lane system. The memory effect of flux difference is considered in the new model to suppress the traffic jam. The critical condition of the model is analyzed by control method. The simulations are applied to verify the influence of feedback control signal on alleviating traffic jam. Besides, energy consumption simulation is designed in this paper. All the results demonstrate that the memory effect of flux difference model enhances the stability of traffic flow. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Contact stresses distributions may substantially reduce the fatigue life of components subject to fretting, leading to early unexpected failures. Accurately predicting the components lives is, therefore, an important topic to be addressed, in particular from a design point of view. This topic has received great attention in the past decades and several numerical tools that better estimate these components lives have been proposed. In this paper, the focus is in the crack initiation phase. At this stage, it is important to correctly predict the crack initiation location and orientation, which is often achieved by using critical plane approaches. Instead, the use of cohesive zone model (CZM) as an alternative approach to accurately estimate those parameters is investigated. Cohesive zone model as well as two of its common initiation criteria, namely quadratic traction-separation criterion and maximum nominal stress criterion, are used to study crack initiation location and orientation under fretting conditions. Our results are compared with the traditional critical plane approaches and with experimental data, suggesting that cohesive approaches can accurately be used in crack initiation prediction.

AB Grain-size effect on functional properties of piezoceramics is nowadays an important topic due to the potential applications of these materials at the submicron scale. In this context, we explore the effect of the grain size reduction on the functional properties stability of piezoceramics. Submicron- and micro-structured Pb(Zr,Ti)O-3 based materials are taken as model samples to carry out this study. Rayleigh analysis is used to quantitatively evaluate the domain wall contribution. The results show that the stability of properties depends strongly on grain size. Specifically, the nonlinear response decreases significantly when the grain size is reduced to the submicron scale. This behavior can be explained by taking into account that a grain size reduction involves a grain boundary increment, which may clamp domain walls. The results suggest that grain size engineering may be an effective alternative to the widely used compositional engineering in order to control the undesirable nonlinear behavior in piezoceramics.

AB In order to improve image reconstructions, different classes of nonlinear inversion algorithms are developed and used in different research topics like imaging processes in oil industry or the characterization of complex porous media or multiphase flows. These algorithms are able to avoid local minima and to reach more adapted minima of a given misfit function between observed/measured and computed data. Techniques as different as electrical, ultrasound or potential methods, are used. We present here a nonlinear algorithm that allows us to produce permittivity images by using electrical capacitance tomography (ECT). ECT is a non-invasive technique to image non-conductive permittivity distributions and is used in many oil industry imaging applications such as multiphase flows in pipelines, fluidized bed reactors, mixing vessels, and tanks of phase separation. Even if the ECT technique provides low resolution reconstructions, it is cheap, robust and very fast when compared to other imaging tools. In this method one or more rings of electrodes excite a medium to be imaged at high frequencies, and more particularly at frequencies for which a static electrical potential field has fully developed. In many studies of other research groups only one ring of sources is introduced but the reconstruction accuracy was not totally satisfactory due to the 3D nature of the problem to be solved. Instead of using nonlinear stochastic algorithms like the simulated annealing (SA) technique that we optimized in previous studies to image permittivity distributions of granular or solid materials as well as real oil-gas or two-phase flows in 2D cylindrical vessel configurations, we propose here a new ECT inversion tool to image permittivities in a 3D cylindrical configuration. 3D stochastic optimization methods such as SA, neural networks, genetic algorithms can become computationally too prohibitive, and classical local or linear inversion methods excessively smooth images in many cases. Therefore, we propose here a 3D parallel inversion procedure with different numbers of rings and different L-p norms, with1 < p <= 2, applied to the model regularization of the misfit function to increase the resolution of the models after inversion. We are able to better reconstruct two-phase and three-phase (oil, gas and solids) mixtures by combining L-p-norm regularizations of the misfit function to minimize and several rings of electrodes. All these algorithms have been implemented in a more general parallel framework TOMOFAST-X designed for multi-physics joint inversion purposes, and could also be used in other fields of research such as larger-scale geophysical exploration for instance.

AB Software Process Improvement (SPI) models are a very important topic for SPI practitioners and software engineering students hence is required to improve comprehension about process assessment models. This paper proposes a visual tracking of the ISO/IEC 33000 Assessment Framework through a multi-layered representational model describing the standard in a highly practical way via structural and behavioral views and graphical reporting. This kind of representation comprises several semantic layers according to model dimensions and including, besides an additional dimension for specifying measurements. The structural elements of the model are assigned on distinct layers and connected among them with connectors of dependence and co-occurrence when applying the Assessment Model to software processes. The representation model was tested by software developers, academic experts and software students.

The ISO/IEC29110 basic profile has been defined as solution for these small companies, and literature related to this standard provides some insights on the potential results and benefits for VSEs. In this sense, two of the topics which have not been deeply studied yet are the survival analysis of VSEs, and an analysis of ISO/IEC29110 basic profile areas. In fact, this paper provides a survival analysis of 90 improvement initiatives, and an analysis of the ISO/IEC29110 basic profile areas. Non-parametric and semi parametric models are used in order to analyse survivability and we analyse project management and software implementation practices defined by ISO/IEC29110 basic profile

ID SOCIAL NETWORKS; RECOMMENDATION; MODEL
AB In social networks, link establishment among users is affected by diversity correlations. In this paper, we study the formation of links, map correlations into multidimensional network spaces and apply their behavioral and structural features to the problem of link prediction. First, by exploring user behavioral correlation and network structural correlation, we map them into three network spaces: following space, interaction space and structure space. With a hierarchical process, the coupling relationship between the spaces can be reduced and we can analyze the correlation in each space separately. Second, by taking advantage of the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model for dealing with the polysemy and synonym problems, the traditional text modeling method is improved by Gaussian weighting and applied to user behavior modeling. In this way, the expression ability of topics can be enhanced, and improved topic distribution of user behavior can be obtained to mine user correlations in the following space and the interaction space. Moreover, the method can be extended using the hidden naive Bayesian algorithm which is good at reducing attribute independence. By quantifying the dependencies between common neighbors, we can analyze user correlations in the structure space and multiplex the correlations of the other two spaces to link prediction. The experimental results indicate that the method can effectively improve link prediction performance.

AB Analyzing cyber incident data sets is an important method for deepening our understanding of the evolution of the threat situation. This is a relatively new research topic, and many studies remain to be done. In this paper, we report a statistical analysis of a breach incident data set corresponding to 12 years (2005-2017) of cyber hacking activities that include malware attacks. We show that, in contrast to the findings reported in the literature, both hacking breach incident inter-arrival times and breach sizes should be modeled by stochastic processes, rather than by distributions because they exhibit autocorrelations. Then, we propose particular stochastic process models to, respectively, fit the inter-arrival times and the breach sizes. We also show that these models can predict the inter-arrival times and the breach sizes. In order to get deeper insights into the evolution of hacking breach incidents, we conduct both qualitative and quantitative trend analyses on the data set. We draw a set of cybersecurity insights, including that the threat of cyber hacks is indeed getting worse in terms of their frequency, but not in terms of the magnitude of their damage.

AB Sentiment analysis requires a lot of information coming from different sources and about different topics to be retrieved and fused. For this reason, one of the most important subtasks of sentiment analysis is subjectivity detection, i.e., the removal of 'factual' or 'neutral' comments that lack sentiment. It is possibly the most essential subtask of sentiment analysis as sentiment classifiers are often optimized to categorize text as either negative or positive and, hence, forcefully fit unopinionated sentences into one of these two categories. This article reviews hand-crafted and automatic models for subjectivity detection in the literature. It highlights the key assumptions these models make, the results they obtain, and the issues that still need to be explored to further our understanding of subjective sentences. Lastly, the advantages and limitations of each approach are compared. The methods can be broadly categorized as hand-crafted, automatic, and multi-modal. Hand-crafted templates work well on strong sentiments, however they are unable to identify weakly subjective sentences. Automatic methods such as deep learning provide a meta-level feature representation that generalizes well on new domains and languages. Multi-modal methods can combine the abundant audio and video forms of social data with text using multiple kernels. We conclude that the high-dimensionality of n-gram features and temporal nature of sentiments in long product reviews are the major challenges in sentiment mining from text.

AB Sentiment analysis plays an important role in behavior sciences, which aims to determine the attitude of a speaker or a writer regarding some topic or the overall contextual polarity of a document. The problem nevertheless is not trivial, especially when inferring sentiment or emotion from visual contents, such as images and videos, which are becoming pervasive on the Web. Observing that the sentiment of an image may be reflected only by some spatial regions, a valid question is how to locate the attended spatial areas for enhancing image sentiment analysis. In this paper, we present Sentiment Networks with visual Attention (SentiNet-A) - a novel architecture that integrates visual attention into the successful Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) sentiment classification framework, by training them in an end-to-end manner. To model visual attention, we develop multiple layers to generate the attention distribution over the regions of the image. Furthermore, the saliency map of the image is employed as a priori knowledge and regularizer to holistically refine the attention distribution for sentiment prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted on both Twitter and ARTphoto benchmarks, and our framework achieves superior results when compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Real data often show that from appearance within-class similarity is relatively low and between-class similarity is relatively high, which could increase the difficulty of classification. To classify this kind of data effectively, we learn multiple classification criteria simultaneously, and make different classification criterion be applied to classify different data for the purpose of relieving difficulty of fitting this kind of data and class label only by using a single classifier. Considering that topic model can learn high-level semantic features of the original data, and that mixture of softmax model is an efficient and effective probabilistic ensemble classification method, we embed a mixture of softmax model into latent Dirichlet allocation model, and propose a supervised topic model, supervised latent Dirichlet allocation with a mixture of softmax, and its improved version, supervised latent Dirichlet allocation with a mixture of sparse softmax. Next, we give their parameter estimation algorithms based on variational Expectation Maximization (EM) method. Moreover, we give an approximation method to classify unseen data, and analyze the convergence of the parameter estimation algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models by comparing them with some recently proposed approaches on two real image datasets and one text dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed models. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A graph is one of important mathematical tools to describe ubiquitous relations. In the classical graph theory and some applications, graphs are generally provided in advance, or can at least be defined clearly. Thus, the main focus is to measure/analyze the graphs for mining informative patterns. However, for many real-world scenarios, the graph is often uncertain due to the fact that data associated with the vertices in the graph are high-dimensional, noisy, differently distributed, and even no clear definition. As a result, one needs to design or learn graphs from data prior to any analysis, which in turn affects the subsequent tasks. Therefore, constructing a high-quality graph has become an increasingly hot research problem, which inspired many graph construction methods being proposed in the past years. Since there has been no systematic summary on this topic, in this paper, we review the main-stream graph construction/learning methods involved in both general machine learning algorithms (including semi-supervised learning, clustering, manifold learning, and spectral kernel learning, etc.) and some specific applications (especially, the modeling and analysis of functional brain connectivity). Additionally, we introduce a matrix-regularized graph learning framework that can benefit to unify some existing graph construction models and develop new graph learning algorithms. Finally, we discuss several related topics and some promising research directions in this field. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is a fundamental topic of pattern classification and machine learning. For classification tasks, DR is typically employed as a pre-processing step, succeeded by an independent classifier training stage. However, such independent operation of the two stages often limits the final classification performance notably, as the generated subspace may not be maximally beneficial or appropriate to the learning task at hand. This problem is further accentuated for high-dimensional data classification in situations of the limited number of samples. To address this problem, we develop a novel joint learning model for classification, referred to as two-layer mixture of factor analyzers with joint factor loading (2L-MJFA). Specifically, the model adopts a special two-layer mixture or a mixture of mixtures structure, where each component represents each specific class as a mixture of factor analyzers (MFA). Importantly, all the involved factor analyzers are intentionally designed so that they share the same loading matrix. This, apart from operating as the DR matrix, largely reduces the parameters and makes the proposed algorithm very suitable to small dataset situations. Additionally, we propose a modified expectation maximization algorithm to train the proposed model. A series of simulation experiments demonstrate that what we propose significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms on various benchmark datasets. Finally, since factor analyzers are closely linked with Auto-encoder networks, the proposed idea could be of particular utility to the community of neural networks. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Education research has acknowledged the value of transformation, which offers an opportunity for researching and rethinking how appropriate and successful educational practices may be. However, despite the role of transformation in higher education and particularly in sustainability learning, there is a paucity of studies which examine the extent to which transformation and learning on matters related to sustainable development may be integrated.
   Based on this perceived research need, the purpose of this article is to present how transformation in learning in education for sustainability requires the commitment of Faculty and the engament of students. To do this, a set of qualitative case studies were used in higher education institutions across seven countries (Brazil, Serbia, Latvia, South Africa, Spain, Syria, UK). The findings revealed that the concept of education for sustainable development has not been sufficiently integrated into the concept of transformation in higher education institutions. It also found that to enhance sustainability in the curricula, academics should develop collaborative approaches, and discuss how to redesign their own disciplines, and how to appreciate the epistemology and multicultural vision of sustainability, both as a topic, and as a field of education research. It was further found that reflections of the academics on their own values are crucial for developing the transformative potential of students as agents of a sustainable future. It is necessary that universities should transform to serve as models of social justice and environmental stewardship, and to foster sustainability learning. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Due to manufacturing variations of composite parts, assembly gap and consequent shimming widely occur in the airframe skin-structure. To guarantee the safety and reliability, the aircraft manufacturers expect to fully understand the effect of assembly gap and shimming on the loading behavior of composite skin joints. One of the main concerns is the effect of interface gap and shimming on the elastic stress state at the hole due to skin joints involve significant stress concentration and composite parts present brittleness and limited stress relief ability. But this topic has not yet been reported so far. In this paper, the effect of joining interface condition (including both shimming and interface gap) on three-dimensional layer-by-layer stress field at the countersunk hole of single-lap countersunk composite joints was fully and systematically investigated by employing a three-dimensional FE model. Shimming conditions include material type and shim thickness, and interface gap conditions include gap span and gap thickness. Some previously unrevealed conclusions were concluded. This study could contribute to improving the reliability of composite airframe, and benefit both design and manufacture in aircraft industry.

AB Extreme events (i.e. terrorist attacks, vehicle impacts, explosions, etc.) often cause local damage to building structures and pose a serious threat when one or more vertical load-bearing components fail, leading to the progressive collapse of the entire structure or a large part of it. Since the beginning of the 21st century there has been growing interest in the risks associated with extreme events, especially after the attacks on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma in 1995 and on the World Trade Center in New York in 2001. The accent is now on achieving resilient buildings that can remain operational after such an event, especially when they form part of critical infrastructures, are occupied by a large number of people, or are open to the public. This paper presents an ambitious review that describes all the main advances that have taken place since the beginning of the 21st century in the field of progressive collapse and robustness of buildings. Widely diverse aspects are dealt with, including: (1) a collection of conceptual definitions, (2) bibliometric details, (3) the present situation and evolution of codes and design recommendations, (4) quantification of robustness, (5) assessing the risk of progressive collapse, (6) experimental tests, (7) numerical modelling, and (8) research needs. Considering the comprehensive range of these aspects, this paper could be of great use to professionals and researchers who intend to enter the field of the progressive collapse of building structures and also to other experts who require an extensive and up-to-date view of this topic.

AB Risk-targeted hazard assessment aims at estimating the design ground shaking that leads to a uniform distribution of the collapse probability of buildings within a given region. An essential aspect of this methodology relies on the definition of the relationship between the collapse probability of buildings designed according to modern seismic regulations and the considered design ground motion. This study adds to previous research on the topic of seismic risk-targeted hazard assessment by investigating how the collapse probability varies with the design level of ground motion, and how this variability influences the resulting seismic risk across Europe. A large number of structures designed according to the most recent seismic regulation in Europe have been analysed. These structures were designed for increasing levels of peak ground acceleration ranging from values close to zero (Le. buildings located in regions with very low seismic hazard) up to 0.40 g (i.e. moderate to high seismic hazard). Each structure was modelled as a tri-dimensional finite element model, and tested against a set of ground motion records using nonlinear dynamic analyses. Several fragility functions were derived for yielding and collapse damage states, and combined with the seismic hazard curves from the European project SHARE to calculate the spatial distribution of earthquake risk across Europe.

AB Compressive behavior of columns strengthened by means of an outer elastic confinement provided e.g. by fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) jackets has become a main topic in the field of structural retrofitting. In details, the problem of the response assessment of strengthened columns is still under study. Many analytical formulations have been proposed to describe the compressive behavior of confined concrete under both monotonic and cyclic loads. However, the effect of a stress/strain level in the columns already present prior to apply the confinement has been generally neglected until now, also because of the lack of well defined strategies of modeling.
   In this frame, here, (1) a FEM assessment strategy is presented and discussed referred to FRP-confined reinforced concrete columns subjected to monotonic compressive loads; (2) to this aim, first, a modified stress-strain law for the concrete is proposed for the FE analysis able to capture the softening/hardening behaviour differently from the laws of unconfined concrete commonly used as input; (3) then a law to fix the parameters defining the hardening/softening characteristics starting from the characteristics of the unconfined concrete and of the FRP wrapping is provided.
   After calibrating and validating the above strategy in the case of non preloaded elements, the compressive behavior in the presence of preload is analyzed numerically and compared with experimental results to evaluate the reliability of the FE model approach proposed. Through the paper, the procedure for the definition of the law to fix the hardening/softening parameters of the concrete is described.

AB Background: Epidemiological surveys on depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among civilian war survivors in war-afflicted regions have produced heterogeneous prevalence estimates of these conditions.
   Methods: To determine the prevalence of both depression and PTSD in civilian war survivors in the area of conflict, we conducted a systematic search of Medline, PsycInfo, and Pilots databases. We included epidemiological studies that had used structured clinical interviews. We conducted random effects meta-analyses on prevalence proportions as well as univariate mixed model meta-regressions.
   Results: We included 33 studies that assessed prevalences of depression (k=18) and/or PTSD (k=30). Across all studies, pooled point prevalences of 0.27 and 0.26 were found for depression and PTSD, respectively. Ten percent of participants fulfilled criteria for both disorders. Surveys with a higher mean age of participants reported higher prevalence of depression. Furthermore, samples with higher rates of unemployment and higher percentages of women reported higher prevalence of PTSD, whereas samples with a higher number of participants living with a partner reported lower prevalence of PTSD.
   Limitations: The findings are limited by poor psychometric reporting practices.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that both depression and PTSD are highly prevalent in war survivors who stayed in the area of conflict. Yet, future research on this topic need to focus on psychometric properties of instruments used to assess psychopathology among war survivors. Notwithstanding this limitation, there is an urgent need for large-scale mental health programs that are appropriate for war-affected countries with limited resources and address depression as much as PTSD.

AB Tinder, also known as the "hook-up app" is the leading online dating application. In this study, we explored the reasons for using Tinder when seeking opportunities for casual sex. We asked whether sexual disgust sensitivity and sociosexuality predict Tinder use with motivation for casual sex. We also tested if gender moderated this relationship. Results of the data collected from 169 Tinder using Amazon Mechanical Turk workers revealed that sexual disgust sensitivity and sociosexuality were predictors of motivation to use Tinder for casual sex. The participants with higher sexual disgust sensitivity reported a lower motivation while the participants with higher sociosexuality reported a higher motivation for casual sex in their Tinder usage. While this model explained the motivation for men, a different model explained women's motivation. Sociosexuality mediated the relationship between sexual disgust sensitivity and the motivation to use Tinder for casual sex for women Tinder users. Results are discussed from an evolutionary perspective. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the field of social network analysis, information diffusion is a focus of current research. Taking into account the real topological relations among the participants and the psychological characteristics of the users, in this paper, a hotspot propagation model based on heterogeneous mean field and evolutionary games is proposed. First, in real social networks, the changes of hotspot's trend could lead to the dynamic changes of users' willingness to participate in the hot topic. This effect is reflected in the dynamic behaviors among the users. In this work, based on the evolutionary games, a dynamic evolution mechanism for users' willingness to participate in hotspot is constructed and dynamically adjusts the infection rate of information dissemination model. Second, in view of the heterogeneity of the real network structure and the complexity of the heterogeneous mean field, graphical evolutionary game is introduced to improve the heterogeneous mean field. Thus, a new dynamics model of information dissemination is constructed based on graphical evolutionary game. Finally, considering the dynamic behavior among the nodes and the heterogeneity of real social networks, we obtain a hotspot propagation model based on dynamic evolution mechanism and improved heterogeneous mean field. To verify the proposed model, we perform simulations over synthetic networks and real network. Experiments show that the model effectively reveal the impact of different driving factors on information dissemination, and predict the trend of information dissemination in social networks.

AB Recently, realistic image generation using deep neural networks has become a hot topic in machine learning and computer vision. Such an image can be generated at pixel level by learning from a large collection of images. Learning to generate colorful cartoon images from black-and-white sketches is not only an interesting research problem, but also a useful application in digital entertainment. In this paper, we investigate the sketch-to-image synthesis problem by using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN). We propose a model called auto-painter which can automatically generate compatible colors given a sketch. Wasserstein distance is used in training cGAN to overcome model collapse and enable the model converged much better. The new model is not only capable of painting hand-draw sketch with compatible colors, but also allowing users to indicate preferred colors. Experimental results on different sketch datasets show that the auto-painter performs better than other existing image-to-image methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Identification of influential users for news and messages propagation constitutes one of the most important topics in analysis of social networks. The success of the spreading process in these networks depends on the mechanism for selection and specification of the influential users. Beside selection of influential users, the distances between selected users should be considered in this mechanism to ensure minimum overlap and maximum coverage of a wider area of the network. Simultaneous meeting of the two objectives may be contradictory. In this paper, we propose a new approach for selection of the set of influential users using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method that seeks to present a solution by considering the above two objectives. The simulation results over real-world and artificial networks demonstrate that the set selected by the proposed approach exhibits greater spread of influence than those selected by the traditional approaches.

AB As one kind of typical network big data, social-information networks (such as Weibo and Twitter) include both the complex network structure among users and the rich microblog/tweets information published by users. Understanding the interplay of rich content and social relationships is potentially valuable to the fundamental network mining task, i.e. the link prediction. Although some of the link prediction methods have been proposed by combining topological and non-topological information simultaneously, the in-depth analysis of the rich content still being in a minority, and the rich content in the social-information networks is still underused in solving link prediction. In this paper, we approach the link prediction problem in social-information network by combining network structure and topic information which is extracted from users' rich content. We first define a kind of user-to-user topic inclusion degree (TID) based on the dissemination mechanism of the published content in the social-information networks, and then construct a TID-based sparse network. On the basis, we build a fusion probabilistic matrix factorization model which solves the link prediction problem by fusing the information of the original following/followed network and the TID-based network in a unified probabilistic matrix factorization framework. We conduct link prediction experiments on two types of real social-information network datasets, i.e. Twitter and Weibo. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective in solving the link prediction problem in social-information networks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID TECHNOLOGY
AB A corpus (eg, patents or news texts) is an important knowledge resource that contains various topics, such as specific technologies or social events. Topic detection models of corpus, eg, Latent Dirichlet Allocation and KeyGraph, provide an important basis for exploring the status quo and trends in science, technology, or social events. However, these models suffer from low retrieval performance as they only consider text own explicit semantics in a single-domain corpus. In addition, many incremental models, such as online-LDA, are based on time slices. In this paper, a new topic detection model is proposed to improve the topic detection performance of a single-domain corpus, which is inspired by a human memory cognitive process (THC). First, to improve the accuracy, distributions over words and inter-word relations across a corpus are utilized as background knowledge, which is a type of implicit semantics, and we can find a more semantic-sensitive part of texts. Second, to realize online topic detection without time slices, we introduce a probability gain-based dynamic probabilistic model to detect latent topics by learning a model based on the dynamic human memory cognitive process. These two steps constitute the framework of our model. The experimental results for four public datasets (Reuters-R8, Reuters-R52, WebKB, and Cade12) reveal that our model is approximately ten percent higher than other baselines (eg, KeyGraph and LDA) on the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI).

AB The capability to rapidly and successfully move into new business models is an important source of sustainable competitive advantage and a key leverage to improve the sustainability performance of organisations. However, research suggests that many business model innovations fail. Despite the importance of the topic, the reasons for failure are relatively unexplored, and there is no comprehensive review of the sustainable business model innovation literature. This research provides a review of the literature, using a systematic database search and cross-reference snowballing. Its key contributions are: (1) a review of the key underlying concepts, discussing their similarities and differences and offer new definitions where there is an identified need; (2) we identify a research gap; and (3) we deduct research questions to address the gap.

AB Social impacts have become increasingly important for urban development in China. In addition, unlike general construction projects, construction projects in high-density urban areas have high levels of complexity and uncertainty. Thus, from a network perspective, an improved social risk analysis theory and a method for these projects were generated in this paper. A case study involving 66 cases of social conflicts in construction projects in China was performed, and 16 social risk factors were summarized. Eight stakeholders related to these social risk factors were then identified based on a literature review and the case database. A theoretical model for social risk network analysis considering the interrelationships between stakeholders and risks was developed by using NetMiner, a social network analysis (SNA) tool. A 2-mode network and two 1-mode networks were used to analyze the relationships among the identified 16 social risk factors and 8 stakeholders. In terms of three-level challenges such as complex environments, the unreasonable behavior of individuals or organizations, and diversified interaction between behaviors and environments, the most important social risks of construction projects in high-density urban areas were explored to help the government implement effective social risk management measures. In addition, multiple, complicated relationships among residents, contractors, governmental authorities, and owners represented a major factor leading to social risk; therefore, more attention should be focused on this topic. The proposed social risk analysis method can increase the attention paid by project managers, governmental authorities, and project owners to social risk factors in high-density areas and provide a structured framework to analyze such social risks, as well as put forth possible solutions to reduce the social impacts on construction projects in high-density urban areas.

AB This article explores a case study of a multimethod approach to students' learning of corporate sustainability. Corporate sustainability here is seen as a comprehensive and multidisciplinary issue, closely related to Corporate Social Responsibility. The basic idea of this article proposes student learning as a joint activity with a corporate partner. Learning is therefore not only to be considered as knowledge acquisition but as mutual development of both students and partner practitioners. To integrate the diverse stakeholders, a multimethod curriculum is suggested which includes, as a central element, a playful modelling approach using childrens' building blocks. Central to this approach is the creation of a shared understanding among a multidisciplinary group to reveal individual learner's creativity with the goal of developing concrete solutions and enrichening theoretic concepts for corporate sustainability. This study is based on a review of existing learning concepts for corporate sustainability combined with conceptual models of playfulness and modelling in learning processes. In the case presented, learning activities and their outcomes are reported on from a family-owned, medium sized, industrial company in France. In the discussion, the authors engage in critical reflection on the outcomes in terms of their relevance for corporate sustainability learning by means of playful modelling and mutual development. The results indicate that the learning process provided for the students should not merely be based on passive consumption but rather on an active discourse with practice and intervention. It can be concluded that the value of the learning approach, with regard to the highly relevant and complex topic of corporate sustainability, lies particularly in the playful modelling approach, which integrates the diverse perspectives and enables multiple development through revealing the learner's creative potential, including emotional aspects.

AB NMF owns the ability to well interpret practical problems owing to its non-negative elements and surprisingly could dig out data's latent factors as human cognition. However, structures recognized from classic NMF are usually not fully localized and always accompanied with noises. In light of this, we introduce an improved framework called SONMFSR (Soft Orthogonal NMF with Sparse Representation), which makes full use of soft orthogonality and sparsity constraints to tackle such problems in this paper. Related experiments show that SONMFSR can excavate diverse and local structures with compact representations. Motivated by these characteristics, as well as the unprecedented need and further study for dynamic topic model (DTM) for timely event analysis, we then extend static SONMFSR to a novel DTM named SONMFSRd by introducing the constraints of emerging, evolving and fading topics. Extensive experiments on two public corpora also demonstrate the superiority of SONMFSRd to some state-of-the-art DTMs in both topic detection and tracking. In particular, SONMFSRd exhibits great potential in real-world applications, where popular topics in Two Sessions 2015 are captured and traced dynamically for possible insights. Moreover, we also provide theoretical support for the proposed schemes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Emotion recognition has become a hot research topic in the past several years due to the large demand of this technology in many practical situations. One challenging task in this topic is to recognize emotion types in a given video clip collected in the wild. In order to solve this problem we propose a multi-cue fusion emotion recognition (MCFER) framework by modeling human emotions from three complementary cues, i.e., facial texture, facial landmark action and audio signal, and then fusing them together. To capture the dynamic change of facial texture we employ a cascaded convolutional neutral network (CNN) and bidirectional recurrent neutral network (BRNN) architecture where facial image from each frame is first fed into CNN to extract high-level texture feature, and then the feature sequence is traversed into BRNN to learn the changes within it. Facial landmark action models the movement of facial muscles explicitly. SVM and CNN are deployed to explore the emotion related patterns in it. Audio signal is also modeled with CNN by extracting low-level acoustic features from segmented clips and then stacking them as an image-like matrix. We fuse these models at both feature level and decision level to further boost the overall performance. Experimental results on two challenging databases demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed MCFER framework. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the rapid increase in the amount of multimedia data, video classification has become a demanding and challenging research topic. Compared with image classification, video classification requires mapping a video that contains hundreds of frames to semantic tags, which poses many challenges to the direct use of advanced models originally designed for image-oriented tasks. On the other hand, continuous frames in a video also give us more visual clues that we can leverage to achieve better classification. One of the most important clues is the context in the spatiotemporal domain. In this paper, we introduce the multiscale deep alternative neural network (DANN), a novel architecture combining the strengths of both convolutional neural network and recurrent neural networks to achieve a deep network that can collect rich context hierarchies for video classification. In particular, the DANN is stacked with alternative layers, each of which consists of a volumetric convolutional layer followed by a recurrent layer. The former acts as a local feature learner, whereas the latter is used to collect contexts. Compared with popular deep feed-forward neural networks, the DANN learns local features and their contexts from the very beginning. This setting enables preserving context evolutions, which we show to be essential for improving the accuracy of video classification. To release the full potential of the DANN, we develop a deeper version with stochastic-layer skip-connections and construct a multiscale DANN to incorporate contexts at different scales. We show how to apply the multiscale DANN for video classification with carefully designed configurations in terms of both input-output settings and training-testing methods. The DANN is shown to be robust to not only human-centric videos, but also natural videos. As there are few large-scale natural disaster video datasets, we construct a new large-scale one and make it publicly available. Experiments on four datasets show the effectiveness of our method for both human actions and natural events.

AB In this paper, we present a novel method to predict the long-term popularity of user-generated content (UGC). At first, the method clusters the dynamics of UGC popularity into a vocabulary of growth in popularity (sequence) by using a mixture model. Eventually, the method assigns to each sequence a topic model to describe the dynamics of the sequence in a compact way. We then use this topic model to identify similar patterns of growth in popularity of newly observed UGC. The proposed method has two key features: First, it considers the historical dynamics of the UGC popularity, and second it provides long-term popularity prediction. Results on the real dataset of UGC show that the proposed method is flexible, and able to accurately forecast the complete growth in popularity of a given UGC.

AB In this paper, we aim to automatically identify and track the interesting social event from vast amounts of social media data. However, there are two existing challenges: 1) how to model multimodal social event data over time and visualize the topic evolution and 2) how to alleviate the tracking drift problem to boost social event tracking accuracy. We propose a novel online multimodal multiexpert learning algorithm for social event tracking. Compared with existing methods, the proposed model has several advantages: First, it has a nonparametric online multimodal tracking module, which is able to not only automatically learn the number of topics from data over time, but also exploit the multimodal property of the social event. Second, it adopts a novel multiexpert minimization restoration scheme and allows the tracked model to evolve backwards to undo undesirable model updates, which helps alleviate the model drift problem of social event tracking. Third, it is able to not only effectively track the multimodal social event, but also automatically exploit the topic evolution of the social event for a deep understanding with multimodal topics. To evaluate the proposed model, we collect a real-world dataset for research on social event tracking with multimodality information. We have conducted extensive experiments, and both qualitative and quantitative evaluation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model.

There are many models on a tectonic scale, but knowledge of deformation at microscopic levels is essential for an understanding of the processes involved. Crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) investigations of minerals in eclogites yield the possibility to study deformation in the crustal part of subducted oceanic lithosphere, as well as subducted continental units containing basic intrusions, which are frequently exhumed during continental collision. From CPO data of omphacite and garnet, as well as other constituent minerals in eclogites, conclusions on stress and strain at depth in currently active subduction zones can be drawn, as the pressure-temperature and strain path of the now exhumed rocks can be unraveled. This contribution provides an overview of CPO studies of eclogites concerning slip systems, deformation, strain and other possible CPO forming mechanisms in all major constituent mineral phases in eclogites and the implications of these microstructural data on subduction zone processes are discussed. Nevertheless, there are still many open questions and future research is essential.

AB Ordinal Regression (OR) aims to model the ordering information between different data categories, which is a crucial topic in multi-label learning. An important class of approaches to OR models the problem as a linear combination of basis functions that map features to a high-dimensional non-linear space. However, most of the basis function-based algorithms are time consuming. We propose an incremental sparse Bayesian approach to OR tasks and introduce an algorithm to sequentially learn the relevant basis functions in the ordinal scenario. Our method, called Incremental Sparse Bayesian Ordinal Regression (ISBOR), automatically optimizes the hyper-parameters via the type-II maximum likelihood method. By exploiting fast marginal likelihood optimization, ISBOR can avoid big matrix inverses, which is the main bottleneck in applying basis function-based algorithms to OR tasks on large-scale datasets. We show that ISBOR can make accurate predictions with parsimonious basis functions while offering automatic estimates of the prediction uncertainty. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real word datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of ISBOR compared to other basis function-based OR approaches. (c) 2018 The Author(s).

AB Person-centered approaches to organizational scholarship can provide critical insights into how sets of related constructs uniquely combine to predict outcomes. Within micro topics, scholars have begun to embrace the use of latent profile analysis (LPA), identifying constellations of constructs related to organizational commitment, turnover intentions, emotional labor, recovery, and well-being, to name a few. Conversely, macro scholars have utilized fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to examine numerous phenomena, such as acquisitions and business strategies, as configurations of explanatory conditions associated with firm-level outcomes. What remains unclear, however, is the extent to which these two approaches deliver similar versus unique insights when applied to the same topic. In this paper, we offer an overview of the ways these two methods converge and diverge, and provide an empirical demonstration by applying both LPA and fsQCA to examine a multidimensional personality construct-core self-evaluations (CSE)-in relation to job satisfaction. In so doing, we offer guidance for scholars who are either choosing between these two methods, or are seeking to use the two methods in a complementary, theory-building manner.

AB Developing an automatic signature verification system is challenging and demands a large number of training samples. This is why synthetic handwriting generation is an emerging topic in document image analysis. Some handwriting synthesizers use the motor equivalence model, the well-established hypothesis from neuroscience, which analyses how a human being accomplishes movement. Specifically, a motor equivalence model divides human actions into two steps: 1) the effector independent step at cognitive level and 2) the effector dependent step at motor level. In fact, recent work reports the successful application to Western scripts of a handwriting synthesizer, based on this theory. This paper aims to adapt this scheme for the generation of synthetic signatures in two Indic scripts, Bengali (Bangla), and Devanagari (Hindi). For this purpose, we use two different online and offline databases for both Bengali and Devanagari signatures. This paper reports an effective synthesizer for static and dynamic signatures written in Devanagari or Bengali scripts. We obtain promising results with artificially generated signatures in terms of appearance and performance when we compare the results with those for real signatures.

TI GII Representation-Based Cross-View Gait Recognition by Discriminative

AB Remote person identification by gait is one of the most important topics in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition. However, gait recognition suffers severely from the appearance variance caused by the view change. It is very common that gait recognition has a high performance when the view is fixed but the performance will have a sharp decrease when the view variance becomes significant. Existing approaches have tried all kinds of strategies like tensor analysis or view transform models to slow down the trend of performance decrease but still have potential for further improvement. In this paper, a discriminative projection with list-wise constraints (DPLC) is proposed to deal with view variance in cross-view gait recognition, which has been further refined by introducing a rectification term to automatically capture the principal discriminative information. The DPLC with rectification (DPLCR) embeds list-wise relative similarity measurement among intraclass and inner-class individuals, which can learn a more discriminative and robust projection. Based on the original DPLCR, we have introduced the kernel trick to exploit nonlinear cross-view correlations and extended DPLCR to deal with the problem of multiview gait recognition. Moreover, a simple yet efficient gait representation, namely gait individuality image (GII), based on gait energy image is proposed, which could better capture the discriminative information for cross view gait recognition. Experiments have been conducted in the CASIA-B database and the experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of both the DPLCR framework and the new GII representation. It is shown that the DPLCR-based cross-view gait recognition has outperformed the-state-of-the-art approaches in almost all cases under large view variance. The combination of the GII representation and the DPLCR has further enhanced the performance to be a new benchmark for cross-view gait recognition.

ID INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL
AB An information retrieval (IR) system can often fail to retrieve relevant documents due to the incomplete specification of information need in the user's query. Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) aims to improve IR effectiveness by exploiting potentially relevant aspects of the information need present in the documents retrieved in an initial search. Standard PRF approaches utilize the information contained in these top ranked documents from the initial search with the assumption that documents as a whole are relevant to the information need. However, in practice, documents are often multi-topical where only a portion of the documents may be relevant to the query. In this situation, exploitation of the topical composition of the top ranked documents, estimated with statistical topic modeling based approaches, can potentially be a useful cue to improve PRF effectiveness. The key idea behind our PRF method is to use the term-topic and the document-topic distributions obtained from topic modeling over the set of top ranked documents to re-rank the initially retrieved documents. The objective is to improve the ranks of documents that are primarily composed of the relevant topics expressed in the information need of the query. Our RF model can further be improved by making use of non-parametric topic modeling, where the number of topics can grow according to the document contents, thus giving the RF model the capability to adjust the number of topics based on the content of the top ranked documents. We empirically validate our topic model based RF approach on two document collections of diverse length and topical composition characteristics: (1) ad-hoc retrieval using the TREC 6-8 and the TREC Robust '04 dataset, and (2) tweet retrieval using the TREC Microblog '11 dataset. Results indicate that our proposed approach increases MAP by up to 9% in comparison to the results obtained with an LDA based language model (for initial retrieval) coupled with the relevance model (for feedback). Moreover, the non-parametric version of our proposed approach is shown to be more effective than its parametric counterpart due to its advantage of adapting the number of topics, improving results by up to 5.6% of MAP compared to the parametric version.

AB PurposeCurrently, the reduction of weight in automotive is a very important topic in order to lower the air pollution. In this context, the purpose of the present paper was to analyze a real case study through a comparison of the environmental sustainability between a conventional steel crossbeam for light commercial vehicles and an innovative lightweight aluminum one.MethodsFor both scenarios, a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment methodology and a sensitivity analysis has been used through the study of the following phases: mineral extraction, component manufacturing, use on vehicle, and end of life. In particular, many primary data and a complete vehicle model simulation with three different European driving cycles have been used in order to reach the highest possible level of accuracy during the analysis.Results and discussionRegarding the manufacturing phase, the aluminum component's production gave the highest impact because of the high energy required in the mineral reduction. Anyway, this stage of the analysis had a low effect on the entire LCA, because the benefit of weight reduction during vehicle use showed a strongly higher contribution. The urban driving cycle had the most relevant impact, as a consequence of the frequent start and stop operations and the longest time with engine at idle speed, while the extra-urban cycle is the less demanding due to its higher average speed and no start and stop.ConclusionsIn conclusion, the present research demonstrated the environmental importance of the lightweight for an actual case study in the commercial vehicles field.

AB Accelerated degradation test (ADT) has been extensively applied to reliability assessment. To improve the efficiency-cost ratio of ADT, the optimal design method of ADT has become a research hot. topic. An optimal design method based on acceleration factor, in which a Wiener degradation model and a step-stress ADT were considered, was proposed in the paper. In order to establish an accurate accelerated degradation model, acceleration factor constant principle was applied to derive the changing rules of Wiener process parameters with accelerated stress. Besides, the exact expression of acceleration factor was determined for a Wiener degradation model. The asymptotic variance of acceleration factor, which was considered as a measure of the consistency of failure mechanisms, was selected to be the objective function of optimal problem so as to ensure that the failure mechanism of products under accelerated stresses is probably consistent with that under the normal use stresses. A numerical example of designing an optimal ADT plan for a certain type electrical connector was studied, in which the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method were validated.

AB Background: Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) are disproportionally affected by HIV and exhibit low levels of HIV testing. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between sex education and subsequent HIV testing among YMSM.
   Methods: Data from sexually active men aged 15-24 years at interview in the 2006-2010 or 2011-2015 National Survey of Family Growth. Sex education included 3 contexts [formal institutions (eg, schools), parents, and health care providers] and specific topics. Outcome variables were ever- and recent-HIV testing. Multivariate models were adjusted for sociodemographics, and data were weighted to account for the complex survey sampling design.
   Results: A total of 323 sexually active YMSM met inclusion criteria. Overall, 42.4% had ever-tested for HIV and 16.9% tested in the previous 12 months. YMSM were more likely to have ever-tested for HIV if they talked with a parent/guardian about how to prevent HIV/AIDS [adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) = 1.48; 95% confidence interval (CD: 1.07 to 2.06], talked with a health care provider about how HIV/AlDs is transmitted (aPR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.38), sexually transmitted diseases (aPR = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.19), condom use (aPR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.30), and the importance of HIV testing (aPR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.22 to 2.73).
   Conclusions: Tailored sex education by parent(s) and health care providers related to HIV/AIDS seems to significantly increase the likelihood of HIV testing among YMSM.

AB Automatic image annotation has emerged as a hot research topic in the last two decades due to its application in social images organization. Most studies treat image annotation as a typical multi-label classification problem, where the shortcoming of this approach lies in that in order to a learn reliable model for label prediction, it requires sufficient number of training images with accurate annotations. Being aware of this, we develop a novel graph regularized low-rank feature mapping for image annotation under semi-supervised multi-label learning framework. Specifically, the proposed method concatenate the prediction models for different tags into a matrix, and introduces the matrix trace norm to capture the correlations among different labels and control the model complexity. In addition, by using graph Laplacian regularization as a smooth operator, the proposed approach can explicitly take into account the local geometric structure on both labeled and unlabeled images. Moreover, considering the tags of labeled images tend to be missing or noisy, we introduce a supplementary ideal label matrix to automatically fill in the missing tags as well as correct noisy tags for given training images. Extensive experiments conducted on five different multi-label image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Previous work has shown that hyperlinks reflect actors' strategic choices; these dyadic relationships depend on the actors' exogenous attributes (e.g., homophily) and the network's endogenous features (e.g., prestige distribution among actors). We combine these factors as explanatory variables in different exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to assess the relative strength of prestige and homophily for the actors' link formation. We analyze the climate change discourse in a hyperlink network formed by US civil society actors from November 2014 and test how relevant the different factors are, including variables such as actor type, country, position, and topic. We find that both prestige and various aspects of homophily influence link formation online. With regard to the importance of the different factors, positional homophily stands out, followed by prestige and other homophily effects. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Optimization is an eternal topic in chemical processes due to limited resources and various safety and environment constraints. The highly intense market competition has led to the realistic significance of optimizing chemical processes. Chemical processes in China have achieved considerable development in recent years, and new challenges to improve operations have emerged along with this development. This paper briefly overviews recent progress made by our laboratory and existing challenges in chemical process optimization. The process optimization is introduced from the perspective of automation hierarchy and its coordination, followed by our major work with emphasis on real-time optimization and advanced control layers. Several cases of comprehensive optimization in typical chemical processes are highlighted in this paper. On the basis of these theoretical and industrial practices, challenges in process operations are discussed. Finally, opportunities for future research directions are proposed for high efficient operations and control of chemical processes.

AB Objectives: In the United States, physician training in Critical Care Medicine has developed as a subspecialty of different primary boards, despite significant commonality in knowledge and skills. The Society of Critical Care Medicine appointed a multidisciplinary Task Force to examine alternative approaches for future training.
   Design: The Task Force reviewed the literature and conducted informal discussions with key stakeholders. Specific topics reviewed included the history of critical care training, commonalities among subspecialties, developments since a similar review in 2004, international experience, quality patient care, and financial and workforce issues.
   Main Results: The Task Force believes that options for future training include establishment of a 1) primary specialty of critical care; 2) unified fellowship and certification process; or 3) unified certification process with separate fellowship programs within the current specialties versus 4) maintaining multiple specialty-based fellowship programs and certification processes.
   Conclusions: 1) Changing the current Critical Care Medicine training paradigms may benefit trainees and patient care. 2) Multiple pathways into critical care training for all interested trainees are desirable for meeting future intensivist workforce demands. 3) The current subspecialties within separate boards are not distinct and well-defined field[s] of medical practice per the American Board of Medical Specialties. Recommendations for first steps are as follows: 1) as the society representing multidisciplinary critical care, the Society of Critical Care Medicine has an opportunity to organize a meeting of all stakeholders to discuss the issues regarding Critical Care Medicine training and consider cooperative approaches for the future. 2) A common Critical Care Medicine examination, possibly with a small percentage of base-specialty-specific questions, should be considered. 3) Institutions with multiple Critical Care Medicine fellowship programs should consider developing joint, multidisciplinary training curricula. 4) The boards that offer Critical Care Medicine examinations, along with national critical care societies, should consider ways to shorten training time.

AB The dose rate profile at different heights above the ground and as a function of distance from the north, west, and south walls of an above-ground waste storage facility was analyzed using the Monte Carlo n-Particle Transport eXtended (MCNPX) radiation transport code. The waste storage facility houses 9,996 waste barrels of conditioned waste. The facility has concrete shielding added to the building walls on the north, west, and east sides, with no such additional shielding towards the roof or the south side wall; instead, the distance from the first row of barrels to the wall is extended to allow for maneuverability of a crane on the south side. The dose rate is computed as a function of distance using MCNPX and assuming a homogeneous Co-60 distribution in each waste barrel. Different dose regions are identified and analyzed based on graphical features and best-fit functions. The dose rates were expected to be largest at the wall of the facility and subsequently decrease continuously with distance from the repository; however, our analysis indicates a peak in dose rate observed for all heights on the north and west sides of the facility. This peak is likely due to scattering in the shielding material and atmosphere, and possibly could be ascribed to skyshine. The difference between the dose rate at 1 m outside the wall and the peak dose rate is significant, and indicates that the dose rate measured close to the wall may not always be conservative for extended sources, such as an above-ground waste storage facility.

AB As one of the fundamental tasks in text analysis, phrase mining aims at extracting quality phrases from a text corpus and has various downstream applications including information extraction/retrieval, taxonomy construction, and topic modeling. Most existing methods rely on complex, trained linguistic analyzers, and thus likely have unsatisfactory performance on text corpora of new domains and genres without extra but expensive adaption. None of the state-of-the-art models, even data-driven models, is fully automated because they require human experts for designing rules or labeling phrases. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for automated phrase mining, AutoPhrase, which supports any language as long as a general knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia) in that language is available, while benefiting from, but not requiring, a POS tagger. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, AutoPhrase has shown significant improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency on five real-world datasets across different domains and languages. Besides, AutoPhrase can be extended to model single-word quality phrases.

AB Influence Maximization (IM), which selects a set of k users (called seed set) from a social network to maximize the expected number of influenced users (called influence spread), is a key algorithmic problem in social influence analysis. Due to its immense application potential and enormous technical challenges, IM has been extensively studied in the past decade. In this paper, we survey and synthesize a wide spectrum of existing studies on IM from an algorithmic perspective, with a special focus on the following key aspects: (1) a review of well-accepted diffusion models that capture the information diffusion process and build the foundation of the IM problem, (2) a fine-grained taxonomy to classify existing IM algorithms based on their design objectives, (3) a rigorous theoretical comparison of existing IM algorithms, and (4) a comprehensive study on the applications of IM techniques in combining with novel context features of social networks such as topic, location, and time. Based on this analysis, we then outline the key challenges and research directions to expand the boundary of IM research.

AB Biological sequence alignment is an important research topic in bioinformatics and continues to attract significant efforts. As biological data grow exponentially, however, most of alignment methods face challenges due to their huge computational costs. HMMER, a suite of bioinformatics tools, is widely used for the analysis of homologous protein and nucleotide sequences with high sensitivity, based on profile hidden Markov models (HMMs). Its latest version, HMMER3, introduces a heuristic pipeline to accelerate the alignment process, which is carried out on central processing units (CPUs) and highly optimized. Only a few acceleration results are reported on the basis of HMMER3. In this paper, we propose a five-tiered parallel framework, CUDAMPF++, to accelerate the most computationally intensive stages in HMMER3's pipeline, multiple/single segment Viterbi (MSV/SSV), on a single graphics processing unit (GPU) without any loss of accuracy. As an architecture-aware design, the proposed framework aims to fully utilize hardware resources via exploiting finer-grained parallelism (multi-sequence alignment) compared with its predecessor (CUDAMPF). In addition, we propose a novel method that proactively sacrifices L1 Cache Hit Ratio (CHR) to get improved performance and scalability in return. A comprehensive evaluation shows that the proposed framework outperforms all existing work and exhibits good consistency in performance regardless of the variation of query models or sequence datasets. For MSV (SSV) kernels, the peak performance of CUDAMPF++ is 283.9 (471.7) GCUPS on a single K40 GPU, and impressive speedups ranging from 1.8x (1.7x) to 168.3x (160.7x) are achieved over the CPU-based implementation (16 cores, 32 threads).

AB Cybercrime has become a growing business. The marketplaces for such businesses tend to be online forums. Much of the research on carding forums has been qualitative, but there have been quantitative analyses as well. One such type of analysis is topic modeling, a clustering technique that groups forum users according to the textual comments they leave. However, this type of research so far has been exclusively quantitative, without qualitatively examining the topics. The following study attempts to add to this research by analyzing the comment histories from 30,469 users from three carding forums. The results have revealed that users belong to one or more of 21 different topics. The topics are grouped into six broader categories, consisting of a customer base, identity fraud market, crimeware market, free content market, and two others. Descriptives are provided displaying how the topics are distributed across the three websites and directions for future research are discussed.

AB Human activity and land-use change are dramatically altering the sizes, geographical distributions and functioning of biological populations worldwide, with tremendous consequences for human well-being. Yet our ability to measure, monitor and forecast biodiversity change - crucial to addressing it - remains limited. Biodiversity monitoring systems are being developed to improve this capacity by deriving metrics of change from an array of insitu data (e.g. field plots or species occurrence records) and Earth observations (EO; e.g. satellite or airborne imagery). However, there are few ecologically based frameworks for integrating these data into meaningful metrics of biodiversity change. Here, I describe how concepts of pattern and scale in ecology could be used to design such a framework. I review three core topics: the role of scale in measuring and modelling biodiversity patterns with EO, scale-dependent challenges linking insitu and EO data and opportunities to apply concepts of pattern and scale to EO to improve biodiversity mapping. From this analysis emerges an actionable approach for measuring, monitoring and forecasting biodiversity change, highlighting key opportunities to establish EO as the backbone of global-scale, science-driven conservation.

AB Exploratory search is a specialised form of information searching behaviour that is open-ended, dynamic and multi-faceted in nature. The study elaborates the picture of exploratory search by concentrating on two theoretical frameworks for studying searching of this type, that is, the berrypicking model and the information foraging theory. The study focuses on two major issues: the motivators for exploratory search and the nature of search processes. The findings draw on the conceptual analysis of 30 key studies on this topic. The berrypicking model posits changing information needs as the main motivator for information searching, while the information foraging theory emphasises the role need for performing a task as a main trigger of information seeking. The berrypicking model devotes more attention to focused searching as a key constituent of exploratory search, while the information foraging theory concentrates on the characterisation of exploratory browsing.

AB As academic institutions creatively respond to exogenous forces requiring fundamental re-imagining of academic work, boundaries are being redrawn between traditional academic/professorial work and academic administration, resulting in blended job roles that constitute an incipient threat to academic values such as freedom and autonomy. After contrasting the nature of academic and nonacademic work, I draw on institutional theory to offer a model examining conditions under which blended academic and administrative roles engender four outcomes: positional dexterity, accommodating citizen, grab bag, and academic gerrymandering. I warn against institutional conditions that foster academic gerrymandering, or the redistricting of academic work for managerial benefit. I end the article with examples of other professions where administrative and core professional work have not been blended intentionally or well, and I suggest topics for future research.

AB Objective: To examine if a brief midwifery education and training session incorporated into annual mandatory training improves the knowledge and confidence of midwives to support healthy weight gain and management in pregnancy.
   Design: An implementation evaluation using a pre-post study design was used. Midwives completed a self-administered questionnaire prior to and following completion of the training session. Objective knowledge, perceived knowledge and confidence in relation to nutrition, physical activity and healthy weight gain and management, and process measures related to the training were assessed.
   Participants and setting: All midwives from a tertiary birthing hospital in Brisbane Australia who attended the annual mandatory training day in 2015 were invited to participate.
   Measurement and findings: Of the 270 midwives who attended the training 154 pre and 114 post training questionnaires were returned. An increase in perceived knowledge across topic areas was reported by 70-97% of respondents, while perceived confidence increased for 83-91% of respondents across each topic area. Objective knowledge score increased from 11 pre-training to 15 post training (maximum score 17) (p < 0.001). Ninety six percent of respondents agreed the training provided practical communication strategies and 100% would recommend the training to others.
   Key conclusions: This brief education session integrated into an existing mandatory training program, improved the knowledge and confidence of midwives in delivering advice and support for healthy pregnancy weight gain.
   Implications for practice: This improvement is the first step in changing practice to prevent excess weight gain during the antenatal period. This program offers an innovative model to support midwives implement change across other health services. A low cost intervention that was well received by midwives can address identified barriers to the provision of best practice care that supports a healthy pregnancy weight gain in a sustainable forum.

AB One of the most discussed topics in battery research is the state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH) determination of traction batteries. Unfortunately, neither is directly measurable and both must be derived from sensor signals using model-based algorithms. These signals can be noisy and erroneous, leading to an inaccurate estimate and, hence, to a limitation of usable battery capacity. A popular approach tackling these difficulties is the dual extended Kalman filter (DEKF). It consists of two extended Kalman filters (EKFs), that synchronously estimate both the battery states and parameters. An analysis of the reliability of the DEKF estimation against realistically fading battery parameters is still a widely discussed subject. This work investigates the DEKF performance from a high-level perspective, involving different load dynamics and SOH stages. A numerical optimization-based approach for the crucial filter parameterization is employed. We show that the DEKF partly improves the accuracy of the SOC estimation compared to the simple EKF over battery lifetime within the operational limits of an automotive application. However, capacity and internal resistance estimation becomes unreliable and partly diverges from the reference under constant and realistic load scenarios coupled with advanced degradation. As a consequence, a downstream use of both parameters in a SOC or SOH estimation is hampered over the battery lifetime. Extensions are needed to improve reliability and enable employment in real-world applications.

AB Accurate estimation of needle deflection is necessary to successfully steer the needle to targets located deep inside the body. In particular, the deflection that occurs until the tissue surface is breached differs according to the tissue shape and stiffness. This topic has not been a focus of previous work. In the present paper, we propose a model with which to estimate the needle deflection that occurs until breaching of the tissue surface with consideration of the tissue shape and stiffness. This model comprises a cantilever beam supported by virtual springs that represent the interaction forces between the needle tip and tissue surface. The effects of different insertion angles and tissue stiffness on needle deflection are represented by changing the spring constants. The model was used in experiments involving four different insertion angles (0A, 15A, 30A, and 45A) and three different polyvinyl chloride (PVC) phantoms with different stiffness (100, 75, and 50%). We verified the proposed model with the 80% PVC phantom and showed a maximum error of 0.04 mm.

AB In visual tracking topic, developing a robust tracking method is very challenging, seen that there are many issues to look at, particularly, fast motion, target appearance changing, background clutter and camera motion. To override these problems, we present a new object tracking method with the fusion of interacting multiple models (IMM) and the particle filter (PF). First, the IMM is applied with a bank of parallel Ha filter to estimate the global motion, the target motion is efficiently represented using only two parametric single models, and an adaptive strategy is preformed to adjust automatically the parameters of the two sub models at each recursive time step. Second, the particle filter is performed to estimate the local motion, we fuse the color and texture features to describe the appearance of the tracked object, we use the alpha Gaussian mixture model (alpha-GMM) to model the color feature distribution, the parameter alpha allows the probability function to possesses a flatter distribution, and the texture feature is represented by the distinctive uniform local binary pattern histogram (DULBP) based on the uniform local binary pattern (ULBP) operator; we fuse then the two features to represent the target's appearance under the particle filter framework.

AB Neuroenhancement involves the use of neurotechnologies to improve cognitive, affective or behavioural functioning, where these are not judged to be clinically impaired. Questions about enhancement have become one of the key topics of neuroethics over the past decade. The current study draws on in-depth public engagement activities in ten European countries giving a bottom-up perspective on the ethics and desirability of enhancement. This informed the design of an online contrastive vignette experiment that was administered to representative samples of 1000 respondents in the ten countries and the United States. The experiment investigated how the gender of the protagonist, his or her level of performance, the efficacy of the enhancer and the mode of enhancement affected support for neuroenhancement in both educational and employment contexts. Of these, higher efficacy and lower performance were found to increase willingness to support enhancement. A series of commonly articulated claims about the individual and societal dimensions of neuroenhancement were derived from the public engagement activities. Underlying these claims, multivariate analysis identified two social values. The Societal/Protective highlights counter normative consequences and opposes the use enhancers. The Individual/Proactionary highlights opportunities and supports use. For most respondents these values are not mutually exclusive. This suggests that for many neuroenhancement is viewed simultaneously as a source of both promise and concern.

AB The bond-slip relationship for the interface between concrete and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) has become a hot research topic. Aimed at the disadvantage of traditional measurement approaches, a stereovision method corrected by epipolar constraint is proposed to measure slip curves of CFRP-concrete interface in the present paper. The proposed stereovision measurement method employs the epipolar constraint to correct digital image correlation (DIC) matching result. The nearest point located on the right epipolar line to DIC matching result is chosen as the new matching point on the right image. Furthermore, this correction method is extended to the sequential matching of right images. The precision comparison test and the detection test of slip for CFRP-concrete interface are performed on the universal testing machine. Results of the precision comparison test show that the proposed stereovision method can improve the measurement accuracy. Experimental results of slip detection of CFRP-concrete interface show that the displacement curves obtained by the proposed stereovision method are in good agreement with that of the linear variable differential transformer (LVDT); this manifests the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed stereovision method, indicating that the proposed stereovision method can be used to measure the entire slip curves of CFRP-concrete interface.

AB 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2 DS) is widely known as one of the most compelling genetic models of schizophrenia so far, being almost 40% of the carriers affected by psychotic symptoms. Moreover, most of these subjects also show impairment in social cognition, which is a comprehensive array of function that guides social interaction with the others, leading as well to the acquisition of new cognitive and social skills. In the last decade researchers have argued whether social cognition dysfunctions could be underlined by specific genetic alterations, and whether these are linked to specific clinical features. Some valid candidate genes are RTN4R, that encodes a protein which inhibits axonal sprouting, DGCR8, crucial in mRNA processing, or catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and proline oxydase 1 (PRODH), involved in catecholamine metabolism in frontal cortex. This is the first article to address the topic of social cognition in 22q11.2 DS from a wide perspective, with a highlight on its genetic characteristics. We will provide a narrative review of the most recent findings and we will point out new directions on this research path, in order to achieve an effective characterization of the neurobiological system underlying social behavior.

AB Recent studies have shown that probucol (PB), a hipocholesterolemic agent with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, presents neuroprotective properties. On the other hand, adverse effects have limited PB's clinical application. Thus, the search for PB derivatives with no or less adverse effects has been a topic of research. In this study, we present a novel organoselenium PB derivative (RC513) and investigate its potential protective activity in an in vitro experimental model of oxidative toxicity induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBuOOH) in HT22 neuronal cells, as well as exploit potential protective mechanisms. tBuOOH exposure caused a significant decrease in the cell viability, which was preceded by (i) increased reactive species generation and (ii) decreased mitochondrial maximum oxygen consumption rate. RC513 pretreatment (48 h) significantly prevented the tBuOOH-induced decrease of cell viability, RS generation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Of note, RC513 significantly increased glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and mRNA expression of GPx1, a key enzyme involved in peroxide detoxification. The use of mercaptosuccinic acid, an inhibitor of GPx, significantly decreased the protective activity of RC513 against tBuOOH-induced cytotoxicity in HT22 cells, highlighting the importance of GPx upregulation in the observed protection. In summary, the results showed a significant protective activity of a novel PB derivative against tBuOOH-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which was related to the upregulation of GPx. Our results point to RC513 as a promising neuroprotective molecule, even though studies concerning potential beneficial effects and safety aspects of RC513 under in vivo conditions are well warranted.

AB Since the early forties, researchers from around the world have been studying the phenomenon of deadtime in radiation detectors. Many have attempted to develop models to represent this phenomenon. Two highly idealized models; paralyzable and non-paralyzable are commonly used by most individuals involved in radiation measurements. Most put little thought about the operating conditions and applicability of these ideal models for their experimental conditions. So far, there is no general agreement on the applicability of any given model for a specific detector under specific operating conditions, let alone a universal model for all detectors and all operating conditions. Further the related problem of pile-up is often confused with the deadtime phenomenon. Much work, is needed to devise a generalized and practical solution to these related problems. Many methods have been developed to measure and compensate for the detector deadtime count loss, and many researchers have addressed deadtime and pulse pile-up. The goal of this article is to summarize the state of science of deadtime; measurement and compensation techniques as proposed by some of the most significant work on these topics and to review the deadtime correction models applicable to present day radiation detection systems.

AB Since the 1980s, Terrestrial laser scanning is successfully adopted in geodesy for contact-free measurements. Collecting dense point-clouds by using TLS is proven as increasingly useful in several other quasi-geodetic, structural, and civil engineering applications. In the study, the newest trend of harnessing TLS is discussed in association with assessing the properties of a scanned object as opposed to its geometrical location. The most promising area of the aforementioned application of TLS is moisture detection in buildings and structures. The present study involved a thorough research programme dedicated to this topic as described in previous publications. Different scanners utilizing visible green and infrared laser beam were harnessed in the research programme. Such aspects of scanning porous construction materials as roughness, colour and presence of water are analysed. Based on the experience, the possibilities and limitations of harnessing TLS for moisture detection in building materials are discussed in the study.

AB Transportation infrastructure is a critical component to a nation's economy, security, and wellbeing. In order to keep up with the rising population, there is a great need for more efficient and cost-effective technologies and techniques to not only repair the infrastructure, but also to advance and expand the transportation infrastructure to sustain the growing population. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been widely adopted in the building industry, and its established methods and technologies show enormous potential in benefiting the transportation industry. The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review and critical analysis of BIM for transportation infrastructure. A total of 189 publications in the area of BIM for transportation infrastructure were reviewed, including journal articles, conference proceedings, and published reports. Additionally, schemas and file formats from 9 main categories and 34 areas related to transportation infrastructure were reviewed. An application was developed to collect, store, and analyze the publications. Various algorithms were developed and implemented to help in the automation and analysis of the review. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date literature review and critical analysis of research areas regarding BIM for transportation infrastructure to further facilitate research and applications in this domain. Based on the results of the analysis, current topics and trends, applications and uses, emerging technologies, benefits, challenges and limitations, research gaps, and future needs are discussed. Significantly, the contribution of this paper is providing the foundation of current research, gaps, and emerging technologies needed to facilitate further research and applications for both academia and industry stakeholders to develop more efficient and cost-effective techniques necessary to repair, advance, and expand the transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, the results show that the use of BIM for transportation infrastructure has been increasing, although the research has mainly been focusing on roads, highways, and bridges. The results also reveal a major need for a standard neutral exchange format and schema to promote interoperability. Most importantly, the continuing collaboration between academia and industry is required to mitigate most challenges and to realize the full potential of BIM for transportation infrastructure.

Variously referred to as equivocation, evasion, obfuscation, strategic ambiguity and topic avoidance, among other terms, the concept has a rich history in the communication literature. Covertly dodging questions presents serious social and political problems. This essay focuses on theoretical issues of dodging, specifically the ability for a person to change the subject with an irrelevant answer. Discussion primarily draws upon Grice's theory of conversational implicature and deception research inspired by Grice. Theoretical impediments to detecting dodges are discussed, as well as barriers to accuracy from the perspective of discourse analysts and societal perceptions.

AB The study of discursive understandings of cybervictimisation draws on a dataset of crime news reporting and asks the question of if and how cybervictimisation is construed in ways that differ from other types of (non-digital) victimisation. Building on a critical discourse perspective employing corpus-based text analysis methods, the composition of news discourses about cybervictimisation are analysed, alongside the relationship between such representations and news media discourse on crime victimisation generally. The aim is to see what effect the presence of a digital dimension has for how the notion of victimisation is socially and culturally understood. The study shows, first, that news reporting on cybervictimisation has a strong bias towards crimes that fit well with the notion of the ideal victim' (such as sexual victimisation and bullying) while excluding other types like hacking and identity theft. The question is raised whether victim' discourse is able to account for the latter types or if new understandings and concepts will emerge. Second, the study shows that discourses promoting understandings of technology as contributing to amplifying danger, and that represent technology as potentially undermining social order, are strong in cybervictimisation news reports. These discourses are consequential for who is seen as a legitimate victim and not. Just as it can be very difficult to identify and apprehend perpetrators of cybercrime, so is also the identification and definition of cybervictims ambiguous and demands to be further researched.

AB In the research field of anxiety, previous studies generally focus on emotional responses following threat. A recent model of anxiety proposes that altered anticipation prior to uncertain threat is related with the development of anxiety. Behavioral findings have built the relationship between anxiety and distinct anticipatory processes including attention, estimation of threat, and emotional responses. However, few studies have characterized the brain organization underlying anticipation of uncertain threat and its role in anxiety. In the present study, we used an emotional anticipation paradigm with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the aforementioned topics by employing brain activation and general psychophysiological interactions (gPPI) analysis. In the activation analysis, we found that high trait anxious individuals showed significantly increased activation in the thalamus, middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), as well as decreased activation in the precuneus, during anticipation of uncertain threat compared to the certain condition. In the gPPI analysis, the key regions including the amygdala, dmPFC, and precuneus showed altered connections with distributed brain areas including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), inferior parietal sulcus (IPS), insula, para-hippocampus gyrus (PHA), thalamus, and MTG involved in anticipation of uncertain threat in anxious individuals. Taken together, our findings indicate that during the anticipation of uncertain threat, anxious individuals showed altered activations and functional connectivity in widely distributed brain areas, which may be critical for abnormal perception, estimation, and emotion reactions during the anticipation of uncertain threat.

AB In this paper, a new nonparametric Bayesian model called the dual sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model (HDP-HMM) is proposed for mining activities from a collection of time series data such as trajectories. All the time series data are clustered. Each cluster of time series data, corresponding to a motion pattern, is modeled by an HMM. Our model postulates a set of HMMs that share a common set of states (topics in an analogy with topic models for document processing), but have unique transition distributions. The number of HMMs and the number of topics are both automatically determined. The sticky prior avoids redundant states and makes our HDP-HMM more effective to model multimodal observations. For the application to motion trajectory modeling, topics correspond to motion activities. The learnt topics are clustered into atomic activities which are assigned predicates. We propose a Bayesian inference method to decompose a given trajectory into a sequence of atomic activities. The sources and sinks in the scene are learnt by clustering endpoints (origins and destinations) of trajectories. The semantic motion regions are learnt using the points in trajectories. On combining the learnt sources and sinks, the learnt semantic motion regions, and the learnt sequence of atomic activities, the action represented by a trajectory can be described in natural language in as automatic a way as possible. The effectiveness of our dual sticky HDP-HMM is validated on several trajectory datasets. The effectiveness of the natural language descriptions for motions is demonstrated on the vehicle trajectories extracted from a traffic scene.

AB ObjectiveThis article examines the determinants of father-child contact in Germany after divorce and separation, with a special emphasis on the role of legal child support.
   BackgroundThe contact separated fathers have with their children is a policy-relevant issue that has been intensively addressed in previous research for the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. For continental Europe, there has been far less research on this topic. This article investigated how fathers' union status at childbirth, custody arrangements, and past and present partnership dynamics affect the level of contact they had with their first-born child from a prior union.
   MethodData were used from Wave 2 (2009-2010) to Wave 8 (2015-2016) of the German Family Panel pairfam (). With a final sample size of 285 fathers, population average logistic models were estimated that examined nonresident fathers' probability of having frequent contact versus having little or no contact with their first-born children.
   ResultsWhether a nonresident father shared legal custody with the mother was a decisive factor in whether he had regular contact with his minor child, particularly if he was not living with the mother of the child at the time of delivery. There were strong interaction effects between having joint legal custody and the time since the parental separation. Joint legal custody did not have an immediate impact on father-child contact around the time of separation, but as time elapsed, men without joint legal custody were more likely to lose contact with their children than men with joint legal custody.
   ConclusionJoint legal custody may provide an institutional arrangement for separated parents to exercise their responsibility for the well-being of their children and thus be conducive to regular father-child contact.

AB Semi-supervised learning, which uses a large amount of unlabeled data to improve the performance of a classifier when only a limited amount of labeled data is available, has become a hot topic in machine learning research recently. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised ensemble of classifiers approach, for learning in time-varying data streams. This algorithm maintains all the desirable properties of the semi-supervised Co-trained random FOREST algorithm (Co-Forest) and extends it into evolving data streams. It assigns a weight to each example according to Poisson(1) to simulate the bootstrap sample method in data streams, which is used to keep the diversity of Random Forest. By utilizing incremental learning technology, it avoids unnecessary repetition training and improves the accuracy of base models. In addition, the ADaptive WINdowing (ADWIN2) is introduced to deal with concept drift, which makes it adapt to the varying environment. Empirical evaluation on both synthetic data and UCI data reveals that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised and supervised methods in time-varying data streams, and also achieves relatively high performance in stationary streams.

AB Background and Objectives: Electronic health records (EHRs) convey vast and valuable knowledge about dynamically changing clinical practices. Indeed, clinical documentation entails the inspection of massive number of records across hospitals and hospital sections. The goal of this study is to provide an efficient framework that will help clinicians explore EHRs and attain alternative views related to both patient-segments and diseases, like clustering and statistical information about the development of heart diseases (replacement of pacemakers, valve implantation etc.) in co-occurrence with other diseases. The task is challenging, dealing with lengthy health records and a high number of classes in a multi-label setting.
   Methods: LDA is a statistical procedure optimized to explain a document by multinomial distributions on their latent topics and the topics by distributions on related words. These distributions allow to represent collections of texts into a continuous space enabling distance-based associations between documents and also revealing the underlying topics. The topic models were assessed by means of four divergence metrics. In addition, we applied LDA to the task of multi-label document classification of EHRs according to the International Classification of Diseases 10th Clinical Modification (ICD-10). The set of EHRs had assigned 7 codes on average over 970 different codes corresponding to cardiology.
   Results: First, the discriminative ability of topic models was assessed using dissimilarity metrics. Nevertheless, there was an open question regarding the interpretability of automatically discovered topics. To address this issue, we explored the connection between the latent topics and ICD-10. EHRs were represented by means of LDA and, next, supervised classifiers were inferred from those representations. Given the low-dimensional representation provided by LDA, the search was computationally efficient compared to symbolic approaches such as TF-IDF. The classifiers achieved an average AUC of 77.79. As a side contribution, with this work we released the software implemented in Python and R to both train and evaluate the models.
   Conclusions: Topic modeling offers a means of representing EHRs in a small dimensional continuous space. This representation conveys relevant information as hidden topics in a comprehensive manner. Moreover, in practice, this compact representation allowed to extract the ICD-10 codes associated to EHRs.

AB The fire behavior of various large samples polymers assemblies is an under-researched topic. In fire risk assessment. the resultant heat release rate of burning different combustibles has to be known. To highlight interactions between components. 2 types of configurations were tested: juxtaposed and layered materials, using a specific radiant panel setup. For juxtaposed assemblies, results indicated that the more flammable component acted as an accelerator for the global combustion kinetics. For layered assemblies, 2 main phenomena were evidenced: the front material acted as a shield delaying the combustion of the backside material and the presence of a backside material induced a thermal thickening that slowed down the combustion of the front material. The experimental burning behaviors of the assembly were compared with a simulated one calculated from the superposition principle. This method was described by introducing a time offset and/or a slowdown factor in the model. confirmed with the use of different assemblies.

   MethodsWe refer to the relevant literature and briefly describe the related research. The virtual cutting method is introduced, and we discuss the benefits and limitations of these methods and explore possible research directions.
   ResultsVirtual cutting is a category of object deformation. It needs to represent the deformation of models in real time as accurately, robustly and efficiently as possible. To accurately represent models, the method must be able to: (1) model objects with different material properties; (2) handle collision detection and collision response; and (3) update the geometry and topology of the deformable model that is caused by cutting.
   ConclusionVirtual cutting is widely used in surgery simulation, and research of the cutting method is important to the development of surgery simulation.

AB The study of technology and innovation management (TIM) has continued to evolve and expand with great speed over the last three decades. This research aims to identify core topics in TIM studies and explore their dynamic changes. The conventional approach, based on discrete assignments by subjective judgment with predetermined categories, cannot effectively capture latent topics from large volumes of scholarly data. Hence, this study adopts the topic model approach, which automatically discovers topics that pervade a large and unstructured collection of documents, to uncover research topics in TIM research. The 50 topics of TIM research are identified through the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model from 11,693 articles published from 1997 to 2016 in 11 TIM journals, and top 10 most popular topics in TIM research are briefly reviewed. We then explore topic trends by examining the changes in topics rankings over different time periods and identifying hot and cold topics of TIM research over the last two decades. For each of the 11 TIM journals, the areas of subspecialty and the effects of editor changes on topic portfolios are also investigated. The findings of this study are expected to provide implications for researchers, journal editors, and policy makers in the field of TIM.

AB Influence of pollution on dynamics of deep convection continues to be a controversial topic. Arguably, only carefully designed numerical simulations can clearly separate the impact of aerosols from the effects of meteorological factors that affect moist convection. This paper argues that such a separation is virtually impossible using observations because of the insufficient accuracy of atmospheric measurements and the fundamental nature of the interaction between deep convection and its environment. To support this conjecture, results from numerical simulations are presented that apply modeling methodology previously developed by the author. The simulations consider small modifications, difficult to detect in observations, of the initial sounding, surface fluxes, and large-scale forcing tendencies. All these represent variations of meteorological conditions that affect deep convective dynamics independently of aerosols. The setup follows the case of daytime convective development over land based on observations during the Large-Scale Biosphere- Atmosphere (LBA) field project in Amazonia. The simulated observable macroscopic changes of convection, such as the surface precipitation and upper-tropospheric cloudiness, are similar to or larger than those resulting from changes of cloud condensation nuclei from pristine to polluted conditions studied previously using the same modeling case. Observations from Phase III of the Global Atmospheric Research Program Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE) are also used to support the argument concerning the impact of the large-scale forcing. The simulations suggest that the aerosol impacts on dynamics of deep convection cannot be isolated from meteorological effects, at least for the daytime development of unorganized deep convection considered in this study.

AB The analysis of customer pose is one of the most important topics for marketing. Using the customer pose information, the retailers can evaluate the customer interest level to the merchandise. However, the pose estimation is not easy because of the problems of occlusion and left-right similarity. To address these two problems, we propose an Integral Pose Network (IntePoseNet) which incorporates the body orientation and visibility mask. Firstly, benefiting from the simple gaits in retail store, the body orientation can give the global information of pose configuration. For example, if a person is facing to right, the body orientation indicates the occlusion of his or her left body. Similarly, if a person is facing to the camera, his or her right shoulder is probably at the left side of image. The body orientation is fused with local joint connections by a set of novel Orientational Message Passing (OMP) layers in Deep Neural Network. Secondly, the visibility mask models the occlusion state of each joint. It is tightly related to the body orientation because the body orientation is the main reason of self-occlusion. In addition, occluding object (e.g. shopping basket in retail store environment) detection can also give the clues of visibility mask prediction. Furthermore, the system models the temporal consistency by introducing the optical flow and Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network. Therefore, the global body orientation, local joint connections, customer motion, occluding objects and temporal consistency are integrally considered in our system. At last, we conduct a series of comparison experiments to show the effectiveness of our system.

AB A clear understanding of the relationship between ecosystem services (ESs) and urbanization provides new insight into urban landscape planning and decision making. Although a considerable amount of literature has focused on this topic, few studies address the spatial interactions between ESs and urbanization, especially at the local scale. Various models and multisource data were integrated to estimate ESs and urbanization in Wuhan City, China. The bivariate Moran's I methods were employed to test and visualize the spatial correlations between ESs and urbanization. Spatial regression models were used to describe the spatial dependence of ESs on urbanization. Our results showed that all ESs have globally negative spatial correlations with urbanization, but focusing on local scale allowed spatial correlations to be categorized into four types: high ESs and high urbanization, high ESs and low urbanization, low ESs and high urbanization, and low ESs and low urbanization. Spatial regression models were identified as more suitable to measure the spatial dependence of ESs on urbanization, as they account for the effects of spatial autocorrelation. Among ESs, biodiversity conservation was the one most sensitive to increased urbanization, followed by outdoor recreation, water yield, grain productivity, carbon storage, and erosion prevention. The spatial exploration of the relationship between ESs and urbanization provides practical guidance for urban development planning and environmental protection. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Modeling aspects of the human condition in animals has provided invaluable information on the physiology of all organ systems and has assisted in the development of virtually all new therapeutics. Research in cardiovascular disease, cancer, immunology, and other disciplines has benefited substantially from the availability of animal models that capture aspects of specific human diseases and that have been used effectively to advance new treatments. By comparison, animal models for neurological and psychiatric disorders have faced several unique obstacles. This paper highlights topics covered in a recent Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory meeting charged with examining the status of animal models for mental illness. The consensus of the conference is that despite the difficulties inherent with modeling brain disorders in animals, when used judiciously-fully cognizant that models of specific behavioral or biological aspects cannot completely recapitulate the human disorder-animal research is crucial for advancing our understanding of neuropsychiatric disease.

AB It is well-known that as humans age they experience significant changes in gait including reduction in velocity and ground reaction forces and changes in leg mechanics. Progressive changes in gait can lead to disability and frailty, defined as an inability to carry out activities of daily living. This topic is relevant to basic understanding of the aging process and for clinical intervention. As such, studies of frailty can benefit from nonhuman animal models, yet little is known about gait frailty in nonhuman primates. This study examines a nonhuman primate model to evaluate its relevance to understanding human aging processes. To test the null hypothesis that age-related changes in joint function and gait do occur in primate models in a similar fashion to humans, a detailed gait analysis, including velocity, footfall timings, and vertical ground reaction forces, on bipedal locomotion was performed in Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli), ranging in age from 5 years to 24 years. None of the spatiotemporal or kinetic gait variables measured was significantly correlated with age alone. There was a slight but significant reduction in locomotor velocity when animals were grouped into "young" and "old" categories. These data show that aging P. coquereli experience only subtle age-related changes, that were not nearly as extensive as reported in humans. This lack of change suggests that unlike humans, lemurs maintain gait competency at high levels, possibly because these animals maintain reproductive capacity close to their age of death and that frailty may be selected against, since gait disability would result in injury and death that would preclude independent living. Although nonhuman primates should experience age-related senescence, their locomotor performance should remain robust throughout their lifetimes, which raises questions about the use of primate models of gait disability, an area that deserves further investigation.

AB Statistical bounds controlling the total fluctuations in mean and variance about a basic steady-state solution are developed for the truncated barotropic flow over topography. Statistical ensemble prediction is an important topic in weather and climate research. Here, the evolution of an ensemble of trajectories is considered using statistical instability analysis and is compared and contrasted with the classical deterministic instability for the growth of perturbations in one pointwise trajectory. The maximum growth of the total statistics in fluctuations is derived relying on the statistical conservation principle of the pseudo-energy. The saturation bound of the statistical mean fluctuation and variance in the unstable regimes with non-positive-definite pseudo-energy is achieved by linking with a class of stable reference states and minimizing the stable statistical energy. Two cases with dependence on initial statistical uncertainty and on external forcing and dissipation are compared and unified under a consistent statistical stability framework. The flow structures and statistical stability bounds are illustrated and verified by numerical simulations among a wide range of dynamical regimes, where subtle transient statistical instability exists in general with positive short-time exponential growth in the covariance even when the pseudo-energy is positive-definite. Among the various scenarios in this paper, there exist strong forward and backward energy exchanges between different scales which are estimated by the rigorous statistical bounds.

AB De-noising is a crucial topic in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) which focuses on less loss of Magnetic Resonance (MR) image information and details preservation during the noise suppression. Nowadays multiple coil MRI system is preferred to single one due to its acceleration in the imaging process. Due to the fact that the model of noise in single-coil and multiple-coil MRI systems are different, the de-noising methods that mostly are adapted to single-coil MRI systems, do not work appropriately with multiple-coil one. The model of noise in single-coil MRI systems is Rician while in multiple-coil one (if no subsampling occurs in k-space or GRAPPA reconstruction process is being done in the coils), it obeys noncentral Chi (nc-chi). In this paper, a new filtering method based on the Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE) estimator is proposed for multiple-coil MR Images ruined by nc-chi noise. In the presented method, to have an optimum similarity selection of voxels, the Bayesian Mean Square Error (BMSE) criterion is used and proved for nc-chi noise model and also a nonlocal voxel selection methodology is proposed for nc-chi distribution. The results illustrate robust and accurate performance compared to the related state-of-the-art methods, either on ideal nc-chi images or GRAPPA reconstructed ones.

AB The transition of the global energy system is one of the main trends that offers opportunities as well as challenges for the economy. Most literature evaluates the impact of that transition at a national level. That view is broadened towards a regional scale. Due to the lower energy density of many renewable energy sources, renewable energy generation will be more decentralised, leading to potentially significant changes in the regional economy when transitioning to a renewable energy system. In this paper the current literature and methods of assessing regional economic impacts of a transition to renewable energy generation is reviewed. The findings suggest an overall need to clearly define the topics, such as technologies, that are assessed and the evaluated time period. A guideline for a regional impact assessment is provided, focusing on the suitability of applied impact assessment methods (employment ratios, supply chain analyses, input-output models, and computable general equilibrium models).

AB The market diffusion of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) is a research topic which is often addressed, yet PEV market diffusion models differ in their approaches, the factors they include and results. Here, 40 market diffusion models for PEVs are compared in their scope, approach and findings to point out similarities or differences and make recommendations for future improvements in modeling in this field. Important input factors for the US are the purchase price and operating costs, while for Germany energy prices and the charging infrastructure are mentioned more often. Furthermore, larger sales shares of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles than battery electric vehicles are often found in the short term results (until 2030) while the picture is not so clear for the medium-to long-term. Future market penetration models should include specific PEV features like the limited range of battery electric vehicles or access to charging infrastructure, which are currently not covered by many models. Also, the integration of current policy regulations and, if possible, indirect policy incentives would enhance research in this field.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to improve patient education in clinic by evaluating patient perceptions of education provided, as well as patient self-confidence related to topics within cystic fibrosis (CF). The study assessed whether self-confidence matched knowledge and defined patient-specific goals for education timing and information sources.
   Methods: Age specific questionnaires were distributed over four months to patients 11 years of age and older and caregivers of patients of all ages at a single CF Foundation accredited care center.
   Results: Participants reported frequent education on all topics except for reproductive effects of CF and mental health. A positive correlation was seen between overall confidence in CF-related knowledge and performance on a validated knowledge scale in adolescent caregivers only. Participants expected all educational milestones to be met by 13-14 years of age.
   Conclusions: Gaps in CF education remain and educational models should deliver information by the early teens without overlooking reproductive effects and mental health.
   Practice Implications: The educational model for CF clinics should become more comprehensive by including education on topics such as mental health and reproductive effects. Providers are an important pathway for information and should not disregard the value of education provided during clinic visits. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Energy metabolism is determined by a suite of regulatory mechanism, and their increasing complexity over evolutionary time provides the key to understanding the emergence of different metabolic phenotypes. Energy metabolism is at the core of biological processes because all organisms must maintain energy balance against thermodynamic gradients. Energy metabolism is regulated by a bewildering array of interacting molecular mechanisms, and much of what is known about metabolic regulation comes from the medical literature. However, ecology and evolutionary research would gain considerably by incorporating regulatory mechanisms more explicitly in research on topics such as the evolution of endothermy, metabolic plasticity, and energy balance. The purpose of this brief review is to summarise the main regulatory pathways of energy metabolism in animals and their evolutionary origins to make these complex interactions more accessible to researchers from a broad range of backgrounds. Some of the principal regulators of energy balance, such as the AMP-stimulated protein kinase, have an ancient prokaryotic origin. Most regulatory pathways (e.g. thyroid hormone, insulin, adipokines), however, are eukaryotic in origin and diversified substantially in metazoans and vertebrates. Diversification in vertebrates is at least partly due to genome duplications early in this lineage. The interaction between regulatory mechanisms permitted an increasingly sophisticated fine-tuning of energy balance and metabolism. Hence, regulatory complexity increased over evolutionary time, and taxa differ in their potential range of metabolic phenotypes. Choice of model organism therefore becomes important, and bacteria or even invertebrates are not good models for more derived vertebrates. Different metabolic phenotypes and their evolution, such as endothermy and metabolic plasticity, should be interpreted against this regulatory background.

AB This paper is about the control of Modular multilevel converters, an innovative technology in the design of converters, which is beginning to be included in real installations. Papers about this topic include simulation models, circulating current reduction, voltage modulators, capacitor voltage balancing and control issues. The scheme for current source regulation used in this article includes all control loops, which are, from the outermost to innermost, DC bus voltage regulator, current regulator, voltage modulator, capacitor voltage balancing, and a PLL for the synchronization to the grid. Disposition-sinusoidal pulse width modulation is used as the voltage modulator, and an enhanced control strategy in the stationary reference frame for 3-phase MMCs is used for the inner current control loops. Very detailed simulations of the complete control system have been performed for both the enhanced control strategy in the stationary reference frame, and the well-known control in the synchronous reference frame, as well as some experiments using the hardware-in-the-loop simulation technique. The validation of these control strategies is made by a comparison of the capability of each one to compensate the harmonic distortions of the utility grid according to the grid code. The correct operation has been tested in the case of a strong/weak grid, unbalances and grid failures.

ID LASER-PLASMA INTERACTION; FACILITY
AB We describe the characterization of electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) in experiments on solid targets at PALS laser facility in Prague, for energy up to 600 J and intensity up to 10(16)W cm(-2) at focus. Measurements of EMPs have been performed by different conductive probes placed inside and outside the experimental chamber. We show results for different targets and probe configurations, and illustrate effects of spurious direct coupling of these transient fields with the read-out apparatus, which are important for high-energy and high-intensity laser-plasma experiments. The related countermeasures are described and demonstrated to be very effective for improving the signal-to-noise ratio, at expenses of measured bandwidths. They allowed us to detect the EMP components due to the intense neutralization currents flowing through the target holder, and those possibly due to wakefields associated with emitted charged particles, which resulted in these experiments to be of the same order of magnitude. It is the first time both discharge current and associated EMP are effectively measured in the same nanosecond-scale experiment, where this EMP contribution is effectively detected by conductive probes. A remarkable agreement was obtained from comparison of the detected EMP profile with measured neutralization current. We also show the results achieved by means of electromagnetic simulations of fields in the modeled experimental chamber, in particular in the regions where the probes were actually placed during the experiments, and compare them with measured signals. It appears that conductive probes have limitations for the measurement of the high-frequency components of the EMP fields. The illustrated results are of primary importance for the hot topic of EMP characterization and minimization in plants for inertial-confinement-fusion (NIF, LMJ, PETAL) as well as for laser-plasma acceleration (PETAL, ELI, Apollon...).

AB This study investigates knowledge transfer of university research to industry moving forward from traditional indicators by using methods from computational linguistics. We introduce a novel empirical use of pattern recognition and text mining tools to compare scientific publications to company documents. The contribution of the paper is twofold; first, a new method for tracing knowledge transfer is suggested and, second, our understanding of university-industry knowledge transfer is increased by introducing an additional perspective. We find that common text mining tools are suitable to identify concrete chunks of research knowledge within the collaborating industry. The method proves direct links between published university research and the information disclosed by companies in their websites and documents. We offer an extension to commonly used concepts, which rely either on qualitative case studies or the assessment of commercial indicators for the assessment of university research. Our empirical evidence shows that knowledge exchange can be detected with this approach, and, given some additions in the tools selection and adaption, it has the potential to become a supplementary method for the research community.

Germany and China, as the major exporters and volume producers in the automotive industry, have established the goal of becoming market leaders in e-mobility by 2020. Compared to China, Germany, as a forerunner in the field of e-mobility, is unexpectedly lagging behind in both the sale volume of electric vehicles (EVs) and the share of international publications. Since 2006, China has been the second largest single "producer" of EV-related published research, trailing only the United States. However, the technological capabilities-applying science to real-world issues-seem to be under-represented in these publications. This paper explores structural differences in e-mobility research landscapes and examines possible contextual explanations for the differences between Germany and China. The study involves a detailed comparison of articles sourced from the two countries, beginning with a broad overview of recent research and ending with a short content analysis of the statement concerning current progress and practical challenges for e-mobility development in Germany and China. The conclusion reached is that both countries have explored topics related to EV modes, batteries, energy management and the smart grid; however, specific terms of interest have evolved differently in the two countries. Compared with China, Germany has not achieved a rapid increase in the number of international publications but has still accumulated a vast reservoir of scientific talents and technological resources through the scientific collaboration between academia and industry. Universities, as the main loci of scientific research in China, have actively engaged in international cooperation, addressing problems with no apparent differences from those addressed in Germany. The authors' views relative to the development of e-mobility in the two countries vary greatly from group to group, indicating that differences should be considered in both the pattern of knowledge production and the research context.

AB This paper examines the impact of NIH funding on research outcomes using data from 108,803 projects funded by NIH between January 2009 and March 2017. We extend the prior knowledge on this topic by incorporating the correlation structure of multiple research outcomes, as well as a comprehensive list of grant-level features capturing information on funding size, gender composition and funding type. Specifically, we utilize partial least squares regression (PLS) to jointly model all three primary outcomes (publications, patents and citation impact) and identify the effects of grant-level features on research outputs. Our results show that joint modeling of research outcomes via PLS yields a more accurate prediction than analyzing each outcome separately. Additionally, we find that when other grant-level features are held constant, a 2-year-longer project duration would produce a similar improvement in research outputs to that achieved by $1 million in additional funding. Based on this finding, we recommend no-cost extension of funded projects instead of increased funding support to achieve a comparable increase in research outputs. Promoting multi-organizational grants is found to be more effective for increasing patents, whereas encouraging multiple-PI grants is more productive in terms of publications and citation impact. Of the various NIH grant types, program project/center grants (P series) and research training grants (T series) are the two most productive and impactful. Results also suggest that projects with a higher proportion of male PIs tend to produce more research outputs. This finding, however, needs to be interpreted with caution due to the limitation of our data set.

AB Estimation of statistical moments of structural response is one of the main topics for analysis of random systems. The balance between accuracy and efficiency remains a challenge. After investigating of the existing point estimation method (PEM), a new point estimate method based on the dimension-reduction method (DRM) is presented. By introducing transformations, a system with general variables is transformed into the one with independent variables. Then, the existing PEMs based on the DRMs are investigated. Based on the qualitative analysis of difference in the approximations for response function and moment function, a new PEM is proposed, in which the response function is decomposed directly and the moments are calculated by high dimensional integral directly. Compared with the existing PEM based on univariate DRM, the proposed method is more friendly and easier to implement without loss of accuracy and efficiency; as compared with the PEM based on the generalized DRM, the proposed method is of better precision at the cost of nearly the same efficiency and computational complexity, further, it does hold that the even-order moments are nonnegative. Finally, several examples are investigated to verify the performance of the new method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved

AB The current debate on corporate social responsibility was triggered by the understanding that companies should be responsible for mitigating the impacts of their activities on the society and the environment. In this paper, drawing on the structural power of business, we examine the rule-setting power in which sugarcane ethanol companies engage, and then discuss why these companies develop and use institutions to promote sustainability. We use a machine learning algorithm, latent Dirichlet allocation, to identify companies' commitment to sustainability and business-led governance by analyzing a large volume of data from public corporate documents. The results reveal 36 main themes that demonstrate the rule-setting power of the sugarcane ethanol industry through voluntary standards, codes of conduct, and corporate social responsibility these companies use as indicators of superior social and environmental performance and to show sustainability is embedded in companies' priorities. However, the results also show critical issues of unsustainable production practices can affect industry image and stress socio-environmental relationships. These issues can be ameliorated with integrative governance that considers the independence of the sectors involved in ethanol production. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work applies large-scale bibliometric, and visual analytic, techniques to green innovation based on the science Citation Index Expanded and Social Science Citation Index databases over the period of 1981-2016. By analysing the basic characteristics of 2691 publications, the results of this work show that: the domain of green innovation has entered a period of exponential development; the historical development process is distinctly separated into two periods, and the former grew smoothly while the later increased dramatically.; the contributions are geographically and institutionally distinct, with the USA and University of California System the key regions performing such research; the comprehensive strength of the USA sees it rank first in the field, followed by The Netherlands and UK. Only China and India represent the developing nations among the top 15; the extent of auctorial collaboration in this area presents a clear upward trend, but institutional and national collaboration remains low and stable. Besides, distributions of geography, journals and categories, productive authors and frequently cited articles, etc. are obtained: articles in this domain are mainly distributed in the USA, China, and the UK; the most productive journal, and author are the Journal of Cleaner Production, J Blascovich (USA); Environmental Sciences Ecology is the most popular category among all of the publications surveyed; the most highly cited article was written by Laursen K and Salter A and was published in the Strategic Management Journal in 2006. Building on the frequency analysis and co-citation analysis of author keywords, it indicates that: "innovation" is the most highly used keyword; "green technology" is a new emerging topic whose upward trend is accelerating; researchers pay close attention to "environment", as well as "sustainability"; life cycle assessment theory is the most widely used theory; "patents" as a main explanatory variable to measure technical output in econometric models is widely utilized. Finally, several suggestions for the future research are given. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Scholars in environmental accounting have developed many methods, capable to transform raw environmental and socio-economic data into useful information, both to protect natural ecosystems and to define the most appropriate policy and planning options to meet the existing sustainable development goals. Due to the high number of existing research challenges and needs, Beijing Normal University organized a World Summit on Environmental Accounting and Management on "Designing A Prosperous and Sustainable Future", which was held in Beijing on July 4-6, 2016. The main topic of the conference was the inclusion of system-wide effects into on-site environmental impacts, considering an integrated environmental accounting and management framework. The outcomes of this international summit, partially represented by the papers published in this Special Volume, provide an opportunity to assess the most recent progresses in biophysical and socioeconomic accounting, as well as in modelling the impacts of anthropogenic activities on environmental and socioeconomic systems. This SV includes cutting-edge papers, that focused on promoting the theories, ideas and practices involved in ecological accounting and management. All the works are aimed to develop broader perspectives, which can be applied to ecosystem protection, as well as on planning and policy-making in view of a transition toward more sustainable and equitable societies, as indicated through the Sustainable Development Goals.

AB Understanding the energy cost structure of wastewater treatment plants is a relevant topic for plant managers due to the high energy costs and significant saving potentials. Currently, energy cost models are generally generated using logarithmic, exponential or linear functions that could produce not accurate results when the relationship between variables is highly complex and non-linear. In order to overcome this issue, this paper proposes a new methodology based on machine-learning algorithms that perform better with complex datasets. In this paper, machine learning was used to generate high-performing energy cost models for wastewater treatment plants, using a database of 317 wastewater treatment plants located in north-west Europe. The most important variables in energy cost modelling were identified and for the first time, the energy price was used as model parameter and its importance evaluated.

AB Minimization of Radio-Frequency (RF) dissipation on superconducting surfaces is of interest for many applications. A prominent one is the use of Superconducting RF (SRF) cavities for charged particle acceleration. In addition to our previous investigation which characterized the occurrence of high-field non-linear losses by microscopic surface topography, the topic of increased linear losses as a function of surface topographic character merits consideration. Surfaces with isotropic homogeneous surface topography may be well characterized by power spectral density (PSD) derived from systematic height measurements. PSD characterizations of representative niobium cavity surface treatments have been developed: Electro-Polishing (EP), Nano-Mechanical Polishing (NMP) and Centrifugal Barrel Polishing (CBP) A perturbation model based on PSD statistical analysis is used to calculate additional RF loss on these surfaces when superconducting. The model assesses the penetration depth effects for a superconductor. We thus estimate the RF power dissipation ratio between these rough surfaces and an ideal smooth surface.

AB Background: Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at an increased risk for stress, and their children often display high rates of problem behavior. There is a robust literature base showing that training parents to implement applied behavior analytic (ABA) interventions helps reduce their child's challenging behavior. However, some parents continue to report high rates of stress that may interfere with implementation. Adding cognitive-affective strategies such as ACT and optimism training to ABA may be beneficial. Telehealth models have the potential to reach parents who may not otherwise be able to access parent training, making evidence-based programs more readily available.
   Method: Twenty-three parents (with 16 completing posttest assessments) of children with autism (ages four to eight) participated in a three-week online training program. Topics covered included instruction in ABA principles as well as stress reduction strategies and mediation practice based on ACT principles. The intervention included weekly synchronous online meetings with other parents and two parent educators, as well as supplemental assignments completed between sessions.
   Results: We found that after the intervention parents reported: (1) decreases in parental stress, (2) increases in relevant knowledge, (3) increases in child prosocial behavior, (4) decreases in hyperactive behaviors, and (5) high levels of satisfaction with the intervention.
   Conclusions: This online program, combining ABA and stress reduction practices, resulted in positive outcomes for children with autism and their families. Although this was a small sample size, this early investigation offers promise for delivering this combined intervention approach effectively online. Training small groups of parents in an online format may be a feasible, efficient service delivery method.

AB Criticality safety during fuel debris retrieval from the damaged cores of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station (1FNPS) Units 1-3 is an important topic for the overall activity of the plant's decommissioning. Analyses of possible criticality accidents in the fuel debris and its consequences are crucial for safe criticality control. In order to analyze a possible criticality accident, the condition of fuel debris and also potential changes in the fuel debris in terms of, for example, its geometry and the amount of water during fuel debris retrieval must first be known in detail; however, the condition of fuel debris at the 1FNPS is currently unknown. Second, an appropriate method for use in such analyses is crucial. In this study, hypothetical fuel-debris systems, i.e., systems that are to some extent possible at the 1FNPS, were considered. It is reasonable that fuel debris at the 1FNPS is coupled, whereby physically or compositionally distinct debris regions interact with one another via neutron transport. In such coupled systems, a multi-region approach is appropriate as it models a system in a time- and space/region-dependent manner. Accordingly, in the current work, we used the Multi-region Integral Kinetic (MIK) code, a code with a multi-region approach that we had previously developed. The purpose of this study was to confirm the applicability of the multi-region approach to supercritical transient in hypothetical fuel-debris systems with more complicated geometry and composition than those of our previous studies. This study also aimed to investigate the relative impact of several fuel-debris parameters on the supercritical transient. A total of fourteen hypothetical systems were made by varying the three considered parameters. As a result of this study, a region-wise power profile, temperature profile, and energy release were obtained for each system. For the systems studied herein the parameter with the largest impact on the supercritical transient was found to be the enrichment of U-235, followed in most cases by the angle of repose of the conical fragmented debris region, while the height of the consolidated debris region generally had the least impact. Our study showed that the multi-region approach can be a useful tool for analysis of supercritical transient in fuel-debris systems with rather complicated geometry and composition.

AB In Europe, woodland bird populations have been declining since at least the 1970s, and in Britain, around one third of woodland bird species have undergone declines over this period. Habitat change has been highlighted as a possible cause, but for some species clear evidence of this is lacking owing to an incomplete knowledge of the species' habitat requirements. Here, we analyse national data to explain the variation in abundance of a declining woodland bird, the Eurasian Woodcock. A nationwide, species-specific survey of breeding Woodcock was conducted in 2003 and 2013 at 807 and 823 randomly selected 1-km squares respectively. The counts were compared with a range of landscape-scale habitat variables as well as local habitat measures recorded by surveyors, using generalised linear mixed models. Habitat variables were measured at a variety of spatial scales using ring buffers, although our analyses show that strong collinearity between scales hinders interpretation. At large landscape scales, breeding Woodcock abundance was correlated with total woodland area and the way this interacted with woodland type. Woodcock were more abundant in woods containing a more heterogeneous mix of woodland habitat types and in woods further from urban areas. On a smaller spatial scale, Woodcock were less likely to be found at sites dominated by beech Fagus spp. and more likely to occur in woods containing birch Betula spp. The Woodcock's association with large, heterogeneous woods and the apparent attractiveness of certain woodland types present the most relevant topics for future research into the role of habitat change in long-term declines.

In our model the plasma is described by the Vlasov-Poisson system that is equipped with an external magnetic field. We will prove that this model satisfies some basic properties that are necessary for calculus of variations. After that, we will analyze an optimal control problem with a tracking type cost functional with respect to the following topics: necessary conditions of first order for local optimality, derivation of an optimality system, sufficient conditions of second order for local optimality, uniqueness of the optimal control under certain conditions.

AB As a relatively popular practice in recent years, the flipped learning model moves traditional lecturing outside the class, yet it might prove challenging to find appropriate in-class activities that promote research, active learning and higher-order thinking skills. This study attempts to investigate if learner-generated materials could promote active and inquiry-based learning in such a class and help develop positive attitudes towards flipped learning in general. It also seeks to understand the role, perceived value and ease of using authoring tools used to build learning materials in facilitating inquiry-based active learning in the classroom. It adopts a sequential explanatory mixed-methods research design, in which 40 intermediate Turkish learners of English studied various topics in phonetics and phonology by creating learning materials in teams. The analysis of the data from a post-instruction survey and follow-up interviews with 8 participants imply that learner-generated materials produced using user-friendly authoring tools seem to be a good option for learners to get involved in research in a flipped class. The findings also revealed that although the learners reported mostly positive attitudes and that the higher and lower scorers (Moodie Scores) viewed the flipped learning model almost equally valuable, the higher scorers talked more positively about how the course was delivered. However, as the findings indicated, radical changes introduced by both the use of the flipped model itself and new software and a lesson sequence based on thinking, production and research might constitute a major challenge for students that are accustomed to traditional methods.

AB The development of material models for concrete subject to intense dynamic loadings, e.g., impact, penetration and blast loadings, is a topic of current research. A high-fidelity physics-based concrete material model should not only capture the high strain-rate, high pressure and large strain generated by intense dynamic loadings, but also the typical failure phenomena of concrete material, e.g., spalling and cracking. This paper presents a new concrete material model, which includes the advantages and discards the disadvantages of frequently used commercial material models. In this model, a three-invariant failure surface is proposed by interpolating the maximum strength surface and the residual strength surface based on the level of current damage. The compressive damage and tensile damage are separately treated. The compressive damage is a function of the modified equivalent plastic strain, while the tensile damage is based on observations of recent dynamic tensile tests which demonstrated that, at high strain-rate, the fracture strain is a constant and the fracture energy increases with increase of strain-rate. Strain-rate effect is taken into account through the radial enhancement approach where the failure surface is enhanced equally in radial direction. To capture the shear dilation of concrete material that is ignored by most commercial concrete material models, a partially associative flow rule is introduced. Automated generation of parameters is suggested for convenience of practical application. The new concrete material model is implemented into the finite element code LS-DYNA through user defined material model. To validate the new material model, comprehensive single element tests including the uniaxial, biaxial and triaxial compressions and tensions are firstly conducted, where the improved performances are demonstrated by comparisons of corresponding predictions by the commercial concrete material models. Then selected numerical examples covered a wide range of loading intensity are presented, and numerical predictions are found to be in excellent agreement with corresponding experimental data.

AB This study aimed to investigate psychophysiological responses while reading multiple webpages on a debated topic. We measured heart rate (HR) as an index of emotional arousal and heart rate variability (HRV) as an index of emotional regulation. Forty-seven lower secondary school students in grade 7 read four webpages varying for reliability and position on the topic of the potential health risks associated with the use of mobile phones, while their cardiac activity was registered. Post-reading performance of multiple-text comprehension at intertextual level was measured by an essay, which was coded for sourcing (reference to the source information and connection with its content) and argumentation on the topic. Results showed that the type of webpage did not differentiate HR and HRV while reading. However, HR and HRV predicted comprehension across texts as reflected in argumentation, after controlling for prior knowledge and reading comprehension. Specifically, HR was a negative predictor and HRV a positive predictor; the less the students were emotionally reactive to the content read and the more they were able to self-regulate while reading, the greater their multiple-text comprehension, such as the ability to argue about the debated topic. Theoretical and practical contributions of the study are discussed.

AB In this study, we examine the nature of scientific discourse among participants enrolled in two citizen science projects as they engage in collaborative modeling and problem solving. Specifically, we explore the nature of their conversation as they use, the Mental Modeler, an online collaborative modeling tool to facilitate science engagement, systems-thinking and reasoning. This paper applies an analytical approach that uses visual representations and the discourse around building these representations to understand the shifts in scientific discourse and interpret complex interaction patterns between participants and facilitators in the computer-based learning environment. Findings suggest that the Mental Modeler serves as a boundary object that empowers participants and facilitators to collaboratively engage with scientific topics and practices through the development of scientific discourse and deeper learning in problem solving contexts. Findings shows patterns for group modeling in terms of shifting from bottom-up level to top-down level of discussions. In addition, the results show greater group collaboration and interaction when participants engage in the discussion by using the Mental Modeler to plan and model the citizen science projects.

Such diverse group of vehicle classes sharing of the same right-of-way (ROW) results in a type of traffic behaviour called "gap filling" and "virtual lane". At signalized intersections, this behaviour is manifested by the Probably-First-In-Probably-First-Out (PFIPFO) queuing behaviour, which has been defined and described in this paper. A literature review of the topic reveals that previous delay models have focused on homogeneous traffic conditions and cannot be used for the heterogeneous traffic conditions in countries like India without significant modifications. Basic Webster's delay model is among the most widely used around the world, including India, for designing and evaluation of signalized intersections. In this model, the signalized intersection is treated as an M/D/1 queuing system with constant (or deterministic) service times and random arrival times. While this is a reasonable model for lane-disciplined, car-dominated traffic, its suitability for the heterogeneous traffic in India is dubious, as the service times are also rendered random in this case by the differences in vehicle characteristics. Hence an M/M/1 or M/M/N queuing model is more appropriate in such scenario. Considering these points, it is therefore necessary to modify Webster's basic delay model to make it suitable for heterogeneous, weakly lane-disciplined, saturated traffic conditions in India. In the present study, a new model for random delay component using multichannel queuing theory and PFIPFO queuing behaviour is derived for Indian traffic conditions. The proposed model is validated using the results from a micro-simulation and finally it is used to optimize the traffic signal timing for three intersections in Bangalore city.

AB MiRNA-disease association is important to disease diagnosis and treatment. Prediction of miRNA-disease associations is receiving increasing attention. Using the huge number of known databases to predict potential associations between miRNAs and diseases is an important topic in the field of biology and medicine. In this paper, we propose a novel computational method of with Short Acyclic Connections in Heterogeneous Graph (SACMDA). SACMDA obtains AUCs of 0.8770 and 0.8368 during global and local leave-one-out cross validation, respectively. Furthermore, SACMDA has been applied to three important human cancers for performance evaluation. As a result, 92% (Colon Neoplasms), 96% (Carcinoma Hepatocellular) and 94% (Esophageal Neoplasms) of top 50 predicted miRNAs are confirmed by recent experimental reports. What's more, SACMDA could be effectively applied to new diseases and new miRNAs without any known associations, which overcomes the limitations of many previous methods.

AB The integration of the latest breakthroughs in bioinformatics technology from one side and artificial intelligence from another side, enables remarkable advances in the fields of intelligent security guard computational biology, healthcare, and so on. Among them, biometrics based automatic human identification is one of the most fundamental and significant research topic. Human gait, which is a biometric features with the unique capability, has gained significant attentions as the remarkable characteristics of remote accessed, robust and security in the biometrics based human identification. However, the existed methods cannot well handle the indistinctive inter-class differences and large intra-class variations of human gait in real-world situation. In this paper, we have developed an efficient spatial-temporal gait features with deep learning for human identification. First of all, we proposed a gait energy image (GEI) based Siamese neural network to automatically extract robust and discriminative spatial gait features for human identification. Furthermore, we exploit the deep 3-dimensional convolutional networks to learn the human gait convolutional 3D (C3D) as the temporal gait features. Finally, the GEI and C3D gait features are embedded into the null space by the Null Foley-Sammon Transform (NFST). In the new space, the spatial-temporal features are sufficiently combined with distance metric learning to drive the similarity metric to be small for pairs of gait from the same person, and large for pairs from different persons. Consequently, the experiments on the world's largest gait database show our framework impressively outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

AB As one of the mainstream topics in the research field of infrastructure application of FRP composites, the near-surface mounted (NSM) fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) strengthening technique has attracted an increasing attention over the last decade and become an effective alternative to the externally bonded FRP strengthening method. The bond strength (i.e., maximum force that can be developed in the FRP reinforcement) of NSM FRP bonded joints has been extensively studied by worldwide researchers, and several bond strength models have been established. All the existing bond strength models, however, are not able to consider the detrimental effect of insufficient concrete edge distance (i.e., the distance between the groove and the nearer edge of the concrete). To clarify such detrimental effect on the bond strength between NSM FRP strip and concrete, a numerical parametric study, employing a three-dimensional meso-scale model developed by the author for NSM FRP bonded joints, is conducted in the present study. Based on the results from the parametric study, reduction factors are formulated to consider such detrimental effect and a bond strength model incorporating the reduction factors are proposed. The accuracy of the proposed bond strength model is verified with a large test database containing 86 specimens.

AB Nowadays, performance evaluation of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) is a very important topic for researchers and practitioners. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is an appropriate method for assessing performance of SSCM in presence of Big Data. Network DEA (NDEA) can calculate efficiency of multi-stage processes. In this paper, an NDEA model for calculating optimistic and pessimistic efficiency is developed. Our proposed model can incorporate undesirable outputs. Also, our model can rank supply chains in terms of efficiency scores. A case study demonstrates efficacy of our proposed model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Software developers insert logging statements in their source code to record important runtime information; such logged information is valuable for understanding system usage in production and debugging system failures. However, providing proper logging statements remains a manual and challenging task. Missing an important logging statement may increase the difficulty of debugging a system failure, while too much logging can increase system overhead and mask the truly important information. Intuitively, the actual functionality of a software component is one of the major drivers behind logging decisions. For instance, a method maintaining network communications is more likely to be logged than getters and setters. In this paper, we used automatically-computed topics of a code snippet to approximate the functionality of a code snippet. We studied the relationship between the topics of a code snippet and the likelihood of a code snippet being logged (i.e., to contain a logging statement). Our driving intuition is that certain topics in the source code are more likely to be logged than others. To validate our intuition, we conducted a case study on six open source systems, and we found that i) there exists a small number of "log-intensive" topics that are more likely to be logged than other topics; ii) each pair of the studied systems share 12% to 62% common topics, and the likelihood of logging such common topics has a statistically significant correlation of 0.35 to 0.62 among all the studied systems; and iii) our topic-based metrics help explain the likelihood of a code snippet being logged, providing an improvement of 3% to 13% on AUC and 6% to 16% on balanced accuracy over a set of baseline metrics that capture the structural information of a code snippet. Our findings highlight that topics contain valuable information that can help guide and drive developers' logging decisions.

AB The rise in popularity of mobile devices has led to a parallel growth in the size of the app store market, intriguing several research studies and commercial platforms on mining app stores. App store reviews are used to analyze different aspects of app development and evolution. However, app users' feedback does not only exist on the app store. In fact, despite the large quantity of posts that are made daily on social media, the importance and value that these discussions provide remain mostly unused in the context of mobile app development. In this paper, we study how Twitter can provide complementary information to support mobile app development. By analyzing a total of 30,793 apps over a period of six weeks, we found strong correlations between the number of reviews and tweets for most apps. Moreover, through applying machine learning classifiers, topic modeling and subsequent crowd-sourcing, we successfully mined 22.4% additional feature requests and 12.89% additional bug reports from Twitter. We also found that 52.1% of all feature requests and bug reports were discussed on both tweets and reviews. In addition to finding common and unique information from Twitter and the app store, sentiment and content analysis were also performed for 70 randomly selected apps. From this, we found that tweets provided more critical and objective views on apps than reviews from the app store. These results show that app store review mining is indeed not enough; other information sources ultimately provide added value and information for app developers.

AB The recent popularity of remote desktop software and live streaming of composited video has given rise to a growing number of applications that make use of the so-called screen content images that contain a mixture of text, graphics, and photographic imagery. Automatic quality assessment (QA) of screen-content images is necessary to enable tasks, such as quality monitoring, parameter adaptation, and other optimizations. Although QA of natural images has been heavily researched over the last several decades, the QA of screen content images is a relatively new topic. In this paper, we present a QA algorithm called convolutional neural network-based screen content image quality estimator (CNN-SQE), which operates via a fuzzy classification of screen content images into plain text, computer-graphics/cartoons, and natural-image regions. The first two classes are considered to contain synthetic content (text/graphics), and the latter two classes are considered to contain naturalistic content (graphics/photographs), where the overlap of the classes allows the computer graphics/cartoons segments to be analyzed by both text-based and natural-image based features. We present a CNN-based approach for the classification, an edge-structure-based quality degradation model, and a region-size-adaptive quality-fusion strategy. As we will demonstrate, the proposed CNN-SQE algorithm can achieve better/competitive performance as compared with the other state of-the-art QA algorithms.

AB The structural safety and seismic performance assessment of historical masonry churches belonging to cultural heritage is currently a topic of increasing interest in Italy. Recent Italian seismic events have proved that severe damage or collapse can be caused to such typology of structures even by earthquakes of small-to-moderate magnitude. This paper describes the damage occurred in three important historical masonry churches of the outstanding cultural heritage in Mantua, Northern Italy, after the 2012 Emilia earthquake and presents the results of extensive numerical investigations carried out on detailed FE models with an elasto-plastic damage constitutive law for masonry. Historical and documentary research, on-site surveys and visual inspections were fundamental to identify the critical elements and obtain a thorough detailed knowledge of the churches for the development of accurate numerical models. The results of advanced FE analyses were used to investigate the causes of the crack patterns observed after the earthquake, indicating that the damage distribution detected in the churches can be simulated satisfactorily by the numerical approach adopted. Moreover, this study provides additional information on the seismic response of the three churches analyzed under higher PGA than those registered in Mantua during the 2012 Emilia earthquake. Comparisons among the seismic response of the churches are made in terms of predicted damage distribution, maximum normalized displacements and energy density dissipated by tensile damage.

AB The study of thunderstorm outflows and their loading and response of structures is a key topic in modern wind engineering. This paper provides a new contribution to this research by analyzing a wide dataset of 277 wind velocity records characterized by strong transient properties and labeled by thunderstorm outflow. These records have been detected for up to 6 years by 14 anemometers belonging to an extensive in-site monitoring network distributed in the Northern Mediterranean ports. Analyses are carried out in order to extract the parameters of major interest for evaluating the wind loading effects of structures and furnishing a comprehensive statistical characterization of the huge amount of data recorded. Results lead to a novel classification of thunderstorm outflows with reference to the time scale of the gust front passage and their intensity; a refined interpretation of the differences involved by the turbulence intensity, the integral length scale and the gust factor of mesoscale downbursts and synoptic low-pressure systems; a confirmation of the substantial independence of these quantities with respect to the ratio between the height above ground of the sensor and the roughness length of the terrain, together with their correlation with the wind velocity; a new parameterization of the harmonic content of the turbulent fluctuations.

AB Most verifications at the ultimate and serviceability limit states involve the evaluation of the maximum value of a structural parameter and its comparison with a threshold. This evaluation has thus a dominant impact on engineering, design and codes that reflects on the safety and economy of built environment and society. The distribution of the maximum value of the wind-excited response of structures is usually determined by the Davenport's model assuming that the structural response is a random stationary Gaussian process and the up-crossings of high response thresholds are rare independent events. The hypothesis that wind actions are stationary limits the analysis to synoptic phenomena. The hypothesis that wind actions are Gaussian implies that turbulence is small and the atmospheric stratification is neutral. The hypothesis that the up-crossings of high response thresholds are rare independent events raises some doubts on its application to flexible and lowdamped structures, just those structures most susceptible to dynamic wind actions. This paper aims at inspecting this topic with special regard for some aspects almost ignored in literature, namely the properties of real wind velocity records and their influence on the distribution of the maximum value, the simulation of wind velocity histories with particular concern for the length of the signals, and the classic use of some theoretical models of the maximum value with special attention to the aprioristic acceptance of the representativeness of its mean value. Analyses are here carried out in the classic framework of stationary Gaussian processes. The results achieved point out some shortcomings in the classic engineering practice and provide some remarks for future research. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) provide intelligence for the communication between people and physical objects. An important and critical issue in the IoT service applications is how to match the suitable IoT services with service requests. To solve this problem, researchers use semantic modeling methods to make service matching. Semantic modeling methods in IoT extract meta-data from text using rule-based approaches or machine learning techniques often suffer from the scalability and sparseness since text provided by sensors is short and unstructured. In recent years, topic modeling has been used in IoT service matchmaking. However, most topic modeling methods do not perform well in IoT service matchmaking since the text is too short. In order to address the issues, this paper proposes a new topic modeling method to extract topic signatures provided by intelligent devices. The method extends the classical knowledge representation framework and improves the qualities of service information extraction, and this process is able to improve the effectiveness of service matchmaking in IoT service. The framework incorporates human cognition to improve the effectiveness of the algorithm and make the algorithm more robust in heterogeneous systems in the IoT. The usefulness of the method is illustrated via experiments using real datasets. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PAPER
AB The promise of cross-disciplinary scientific collaboration has recently been proven by both technological innovation and scientific research. Much effort has been spent on research collaboration recommendation. A remaining challenge is to make valuable recommendation to specific researchers in specific fields in order to obtain more fruitful cross-disciplinary collaboration. Cross-disciplinary information hides in big data and the relationships between different fields are complicated, complex, and subtle. This paper proposes a method for cross-disciplinary collaboration recommendation (CDCR) to analyze cross-disciplinary collaboration patterns in scholarly big data, and recommend valuable research fields for possible cross disciplinary collaboration. A cross-disciplinary discovery algorithm based on topic modeling is designed to extract potential research fields. Collaboration patterns are examined by analyzing the research field correlations. A recommendation algorithm is developed to provide a specific recommendation list of potential research fields according to the discovered cross-disciplinary collaboration patterns with researchers' profiles. Evaluations conducted based on a real scholarly dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in recommending potentially valuable collaborations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Understanding of the evolutionary mechanism of online social networks is greatly significant for the development of network science, but up to now most present researches on this topic have not enough insight. In this study, firstly we empirically showed the essential evolution characteristics of Renren online social network. The evolution mechanism of online social networks is explained by the perspective of Pareto wealth distribution and bidirectional preferential attachment. Then a novel model is proposed to reproduce the evolution characteristics which are consistent with the ones of Renren online social network, and the evolutionary analytical solution to the proposed model was presented. The results suggest that both Pareto wealth distribution and bidirectional preferential attachment play an important role in the evolution process of online social networks and can help us to understand the evolutionary origin of online social networks. The model has significant implications for dynamic simulation researches of social networks, especially in information diffusion through online communities and infection spreading in real societies.

AB Functional monoacylglycerols (MAG) synthesis is an attractive topic not only due to it transforms biofuel industry by-products into high value-added fine chemicals, but also because of abundant applications and large demands of MAG. With efforts for decades, triacylglycerols (TAG) transesterification with glycerol has been experimental studied at a wide temperature range from ambient temperature about 303 K to elevated temperature more than 500 K with various discrete temperatures or small temperature ranges. What's more, the temperature influences on thermodynamics mechanisms of TAG transesterification with glycerol is a crucial issue but regrettably a gap so far. Therefore, in this paper, a new thermodynamics model is proposed for MAG synthesis predictions. To verify its performances, it is compared with four available and reliable models from literatures and further validated by experimental data. As the most suitable and precise one, proposed new model was used for thermodynamics mechanism analysis. The bottleneck of MAG productivity improvement was found as the second step reaction transforming diacylglycerols (DAG) to MAG due to its non -spontaneity in forward direction. The boundary in 500 K was identified and proposed for the first time as potential restriction to increase MAG productivity. The influences of temperature are more pronounced and conducive for high MAG yield at reaction temperature greater than 500 K. Moreover, a series of kinetic experiments of glycerolysis with OFATG at 473 K-533 K achieved rapidly increase of MAG at about 500 K in a catalyst free system, which verified those conclusions from mechanism analysis in front.

AB With the rapid prevalence of smart mobile devices and the dramatic proliferation of mobile applications (Apps), App recommendation becomes an emergent task that will benefit different stockholders of mobile App ecosystems. However, the extreme sparsity of user-App matrix and many newly emerging Apps create severe challenges, causing CF-based methods to degrade significantly in their recommendation performance. Besides, unlike traditional items, Apps have rights to access users' personal resources (e.g., location, message and contact) which may lead to security risk or privacy leak. Thus, users' choosing of Apps are influenced by not only their personal interests but also their privacy preferences. Moreover, user privacy preferences vary with App categories. In light of the above challenges, we propose a mobile sparse additive generative model (Mobi-SAGE) to recommend Apps by considering both user interests and category-aware user privacy preferences in this paper. To overcome the challenges from data sparsity and cold start, Mobi-SAGE exploits both textual and visual content associated with Apps to learn multi-view topics for user interest modeling. We collected a large-scale and real-world dataset from 360 App store - the biggest Android App platform in China, and conducted extensive experiments on it. The experimental results demonstrate that our Mobi-SAGE consistently and significantly outperforms the other existing state-of-the-art methods, which implies the importance of exploiting category aware user privacy preferences and the multi-modal App content data on personalized App recommendation.

AB The automatic manipulation and shaping of soft rheological objects is a very challenging and hot topic of research. The deformation control of soft objects is eagerly required in economically important applications in the food industry, in surgical robotics, and in the assembly of flexible objects. The main challenges are the estimation of the object deformation properties and the dynamic control of its shape using the motion of a tool, usually actuated by a robot manipulator. The proposed framework addresses these challenges and represents an important breakthrough in the robotic shaping of thin rheological objects. Indeed, this is the first work in the literature in which the out-of-plane robotic shaping of a thin rheological object is modeled and experimentally validated. As a foundation for the proposed framework, a novel catenary-like Mass-Spring-Damper (MSD) model formed of lumped masses interconnected with three-element units is proposed to study and simulate the dynamics of the shaping of a thin rheological material over a moulding object. First, a three-step method for identifying the material properties from experimental tensile tests is proposed and validated. The method has allowed both to identify the material properties and to validate the three-element material model used, thanks to the close agreement between the material mathematical model and the experimental data. Then, a multibody model of the whole rheological object is proposed, which has been validated thanks to the close agreement between the simulated deformation profile and the experimental one. Finally, the validated model is used in order to compare different shaping movements and velocities of the tool by dynamic simulations. A two-step shaping movement, which has been experimentally validated in a robotic cell in industrial environment, results more advantageous with respect to simpler motions since significantly reduced internal forces are generated in the material while the quality of the shaping operation is still guaranteed. The proposed framework has then enabled the realization of the world's first smart manufacturing plant for the high quality robotic shaping of thin rheological objects in the food industry.

AB The role of high-speed rails (HSRs) in urban development remains a much-debated topic, especially with regard to their impacts on surrounding counties without HSR stations. In this study, we construct a theoretical model explaining the relationship between the opening of HSR stations and counties' economic growth. We investigate the effects of HSR stations on county development in China, applying the propensity score-matching difference in-difference method to county-level panel data for China from 2006 to 2014, and we examine whether and under what conditions a resource redistribution effect occurs. The findings are as follows. (1) HSR construction is conducive to the economic growth of the site area, with a promotion effect of 14%. (2) The primary source of this promotion effect is a resource redistribution effect in areas located within 30-110 km (26 min) from the station. This attractive radius significantly differs between coastal and inland areas, with the effect being greater in inland regions than in coastal regions. (3) This difference can be attributed to the heterogeneity of the surrounding counties; the larger the market size of the surrounding counties, the smaller the resource redistribution effect is, and vice versa.

AB Studying the electrical and structural properties of the interface of the gate oxide (SiO2) with silicon carbide (4H-SiC) is a fundamental topic, with important implications for understanding and optimising the performances of metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFETs). In this paper, near interface oxide traps (NIOTs) in lateral 4H-SiC MOSFETs were investigated combining transient gate capacitance measurements (C-t) and state of the art scanning transmission electron microscopy in electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) with sub-nm resolution. The C-t measurements as a function of temperature indicated that the effective NIOTs discharge time is temperature independent and electrons from NIOTs are emitted toward the semiconductor via-tunnelling. The NIOTs discharge time was modelled also taking into account the interface state density in a tunnelling relaxation model and it allowed us to locate traps within a tunnelling distance of up to 1.3 nm from the SiO2/4H-SiC interface. On the other hand, sub-nm resolution STEM-EELS revealed the presence of a non-abrupt (NA) SiO2/4H-SiC interface. The NA interface shows the re-arrangement of the carbon atoms in a sub-stoichiometric SiOx matrix. A mixed sp(2)/sp(3) carbon hybridization in the NA interface region suggests that the interfacial carbon atoms have lost their tetrahedral SiC coordination.

AB Gas hydrates are widely considered to be a crucial topic in oil and gas industries and attracting significant research due to potential applications such as gas storage, separation as well as water desalination. While the guest composition of hydrate phase is vital, due to the experimental difficulties in measuring hydrate composition, very little applicable information is available in the literature. Paradoxically, this is true, in spite of that; completing an experimental database on hydrate composition could have a significant impact on the processes design and modeling. Moreover, this should provide fundamental knowledge of kinetic effects as well as clarifying thermodynamic equilibrium. Hence, this paper was planned with the intent to fill in the gaps, classify and offer an overview of experimentally derived data on hydrate composition for literature. In addition, a thermodynamic model based on the van der Waals and Plat-teeuw approach and Kihara potential was utilized to simulate the hydrate composition along with equilibrium pressure.
   Previous experimental data shows that guest distribution in hydrate phase depends noticeably on the guest composition in vapor phase. In addition, composition of larger molecules, such as propane or butane, in the hydrate phase, is notably higher than in vapor phase. Our simulation results demonstrated that the hydrate composition data from direct measurement (microscopic tools) have been well evaluated by the thermodynamic model. Nevertheless, when structural transition can occur in a system, the thermodynamic model is no longer accurate. In the case of indirect measurements, the thermodynamic model usually predicts well the hydrate composition. Nonetheless, its capability does vary with differing hydrate composition and equilibrium pressure, to the extent that in some cases, it completely fails to predict hydrate composition. This could be due to kinetic effects on the enclathration of guest molecules during the crystallization, errors in experimental techniques to measure the hydrate composition or the model parameters like Kihara potential are not properly applied. Finally, these observations show that more reliable experimental database is needed to study the evolution of guest distribution in hydrate phase and some enhancements are required for the standard thermodynamic model.

AB Water freezing remains a perennial topic of great relevance to many important aspects of our lives; from the climate to human society and from economics to medicine, frozen water profoundly influences our living environment and life activities. There have been numerous publications on water freezing; however, confusion regarding the process of freezing remains. In this review, we mainly focused on the nucleation aspects of water freezing; in particular, we focused on the effect of the surface morphology and nanostructure of foreign bodies. This review covers the recent progress in ice nucleation and anti-freezing strategies within the framework of nucleation principles. In this regard, we first summarize the crystal nucleation theories. Due to high interfacial energy, ice crystallization is primarily controlled by heterogeneous nucleation events, because the homogeneous nucleation barrier of ice is extremely high. In addition to the interfacial energy, the interfacial morphology or nanostructure of foreign bodies plays a diverse role under different supercooling regimes due to the Gibbs-Thomson effect. This effect gives rise to the inverse homogeneous-like nucleation phenomenon, in which foreign bodies have little influence on the nucleation barrier. This ensures the accurate measurement of the nucleation barrier, critical size, and water-ice interfacial energy, in agreement with the latest studies based on a microemulsions approach, metadynamics, the mW model, etc. As a consequence, anti-freezing strategies can be implemented by reducing the nucleation rate through restriction of the contact area of the water/substrate interface, by increasing the heterogeneous nucleation barrier through modification of the interfacial properties of foreign particles, including the interfacial structure and the interaction between the water and foreign particles and by kink kinetics. Within this context, the anti-freezing mechanism of superhydrophobic substrates was reviewed. Therefore, it follows that by significantly reducing the contact area between the water and substrate, superhydrophobic materials can effectively reduce the heterogeneous nucleation rate. We hope that this review will provide a unified picture and guidance for future work on water freezing.

AB The construction sector is considered the most affected by corruption, and the consequences of corruption are serious since the funds of the developing countries are diverted to be used in projects that are very unnecessary or that have cost overruns, leaving enormous debts and dangerous infrastructure and taking lives in their wake due to construction that collapses as a result of ignored construction rules in exchange for bribes (Transparency International, 2005). One of the ways in which to demonstrate that the companies are doing something to reduce this scourge is through the disclosure of anticorruption measures. Therefore, the objectives of this research seek to fill this gap. The first objective is to create an instrument, based on international norms, for measuring anticorruption in organizations, and the second is to determine the anticorruption measures disclosed by the companies in the construction sector. For this purpose, a sample is obtained of 26 companies on a global level (16 companies with global scope and 10 companies with operations in Latin America), and based on secondary sources, such as the annual report, corporate social responsibility report, and code of ethics/conduct, the content analysis is prepared. The resulting instrument was the Anticorruption Model Questionnaire (AMQ). Second, the anticorruption measures disclosed by the companies were primarily related to four topics: the Leadership and Commitment of Senior Management (LC) topic, followed by the Control and Evaluation (CE) topic; the topics of Planning (PL) and Implementation (IM) are the least disclosed.

AB The growing field of the collaborative economy is expanding geometrically and little retrospective work on this evolution has been made so far. A number of literature reviews have been focusing on specific business models of the collaborative economy deemed sustainable such as car-sharing, sharing, peer-to-peer business models, crowdsourcing, access-based consumption, community, or specific platforms (e.g. Uber, Airbnb), and some others with broader areas of focus. This paper presents a thorough bibliometric and network analysis combining both Scopus and Web of Science databases that provides fresh new insights into the evolution of the collaborative economy research field and its increasing coverage of sustainability-related topics. A first step identifies 729 published studies and uses bibliometrics to provide a description of the research field. A second stage involves networks analysis to identify influential authors, impactful publications, as well as established and emergent research clusters. A more thorough content analysis identifies key research topics, the attention granted to sustainability, interrelations, and collaboration patterns in the field. Data mapping techniques graphically depict the evolution of publications over time and identify areas of current research interests and potential directions for future research, namely in sustainability.

AB Given the limited space in this contribution, it is not possible to go into the details of the exciting astrophysical topic of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. It is attempted to emphasize the basics of this basic concept of the hydrostatic evolution of stars as they are driven by the interplay between gravity and nuclear energy generation, which is expressed by the virial theorem. In the case of massive stars roughly above 8M circle dot, the breakdown of the hydrostatic evolution, due to the lack of nuclear energy generation, leads to gravitational collapse followed either by a successful supernova explosion, leaving a neutron star behind, or by a black hole, which is the ultimate end stage. The stars of masses in the lower mass range end their evolution as white dwarfs. The nucleosynthesis process in stars is a complex task. Most of the elements and their isotopes, especially the heavy elements, are produced in an explosive environment, or in the late stages of the asymptotic giant branch stars. The present paper will concentrate mainly on the evolutionary aspects, due to the to limited space given here.

AB Understanding hydrodynamization in microscopic models of heavy-ion collisions has been an important topic in current research. Many lessons obtained within the strongly coupled (holographic) models originate from the properties of transient excitations of equilibrium encapsulated by short-lived quasinormal modes of black holes. This paper aims to develop similar intuition for expanding plasma systems described by a simple model from the weakly coupled domain: the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation. We show that in this kinetic theory setup there are infinitely many transient modes carrying information about the initial distribution function. They all have the same exponential damping set by the relaxation time but are distinguished by different power-law suppressions and different frequencies of oscillations, logarithmic in proper time. Finally, we also analyze the resurgent interplay between the hydrodynamics and transients in this setup.

ID BEARING STRENGTH
AB This paper aims at contributing to a better understanding of the physical-mechanical behaviour of partially loaded areas in reinforced concrete. Following a review of the current state of the art on this topic, which includes a description of the mechanical behaviour and existing predictive models, a remarkable knowledge gap in this standard problem is revealed. A new stress field solution for reinforced concrete blocks under strip loading is developed herein which is based on the lower-bound theorem of limit analysis and adopts a modified Coulomb failure criterion for concrete. Contrary to existing empirical design rules, the new mechanical model consistently accounts for the behaviour of concrete under multiaxial compression as well as the favourable effect of transverse reinforcement. While a comparison of the ultimate loads predicted using the new stress field solution shows a good correlation with the available test data, further experiments are required particularly for the validation of the predicted higher resistances of heavily confined areas as compared to existing design rules.

DE Android application; Energy consumption analysis; Energy prediction;

AB The energy consumption problem is a hot topic in Android communities. The high energy cost caused by improper development brings lots of complaints from users. An effective and efficient energy consumption analysis technique can guide Android developers to improve the energy efficiency of their apps. Existing researches on this problem focus on either system entity level that gives the energy consumption of the hardware, or source line level that calculates the energy cost of source codes. With the consideration of accuracy and cost of analysis, this paper proposes a lightweight and automatic approach to analyze and predict the energy consumption for Android apps. We conduct the study from a method-level and API-level perspective. The method-level analysis gives developers facts about the energy consumption of the user methods in their apps, while the API-level analysis shows the energy consumption of Android APIs, which can help them make good decisions about how to choose appropriate APIs to improve the energy efficiency of an Android app. We construct a statistical model from a set of energy values obtained by Dalvik bytecode based instrumentation and software-based measurement, to predict the energy consumption of method sequences or API sequences. The experiments on several real-world apps show that the proposed techniques have low overhead while persisting acceptable accuracy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Thoroughbred horse breed was developed primarily for racing, and has a significant contribution to the qualitative improvement of many other horse breeds. Despite the importance of Thoroughbred racehorses in historical, cultural, and economical viewpoints, there was no temporal and spatial dynamics of them using the mitogenome sequences. To explore this topic, the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of 14 Thoroughbreds and two Przewalski's horses were determined. These sequences were analyzed together along with 151 previously published horse mitochondrial genomes from a range of breeds across the globe using a Bayesian coalescent approach as well as Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods. The racing horses were revealed to have multiple maternal origins and to be closely related to horses from one Asian, two Middle Eastern, and five European breeds. Thoroughbred horse breed was not directly related to the Przewalski's horse which has been regarded as the closest taxon to the all domestic horses and the only true wild horse species left in the world. Our phylogenomic analyses also supported that there was no apparent correlation between geographic origin or breed and the evolution of global horses. The most recent common ancestor of the Thoroughbreds lived approximately 8,100-111,500 years ago, which was significantly younger than the most recent common ancestor of modern horses (0.7286 My). Bayesian skyline plot revealed that the population expansion of modern horses, including Thoroughbreds, occurred approximately 5,500-11,000 years ago, which coincide with the start of domestication. This is the first phylogenomic study on the Thoroughbred racehorse in association with its spatio-temporal dynamics. The database and genetic history information of Thoroughbred mitogenomes obtained from the present study provide useful information for future horse improvement projects, as well as for the study of horse genomics, conservation, and in association with its geographical distribution.

AB A special issue of the journal Dose-Response entitled "Biological Consequences of Exposure to Mechanical Vibration" is proposed. When there is the interaction of physical agents, such as mechanical vibration to a body, physiological stress can be generated leading to expected and unexpected consequences. The aim is to describe effects due to the stress generated by the energy delivered in biological systems by mechanical vibration produced by different sources through studies involving human beings and experimental models. The evaluation of effects in molecular, cellular, and systemic level will contribute to increase the medical and biological knowledge about the interaction of mechanical vibration, as well as the understanding of the stress and mechanisms of the biological responses of the mechanical vibrations. The main topics will be related to neurophysiological responses to mechanical vibration generated in different sources, clinical approaches of the mechanical vibration generated in oscillating/vibratory platform, undesirable effect of the mechanical vibration generated in oscillating/vibratory platform, mechanical vibration in occupational activities, biological effects of ultrasound and infrasound, and quantification and physical approaches of the mechanical vibration.

AB Locomotor behaviors are critical for survival and enable animals to navigate their environment, find food and evade predators. The circuits in the brain and spinal cord that initiate and maintain such different modes of locomotion in vertebrates have been studied in numerous species for over a century. In recent decades, the zebrafish has emerged as one of the main model systems for the study of locomotion, owing to its experimental amenability, and work in zebrafish has revealed numerous new insights into locomotor circuit function. Here, we review the literature that has led to our current understanding of the neural circuits controlling swimming and escape in zebrafish. We highlight recent studies that have enriched our comprehension of key topics, such as the interactions between premotor excitatory interneurons (INs) and motoneurons (MNs), supraspinal and spinal circuits that coordinate escape maneuvers, and developmental changes in overall circuit composition. We also discuss roles for neuromodulators and sensory inputs in modifying the relative strengths of constituent circuit components to provide flexibility in zebrafish behavior, allowing the animal to accommodate changes in the environment. We aim to provide a coherent framework for understanding the circuitry in the brain and spinal cord of zebrafish that allows the animal to flexibly transition between different speeds, and modes, of locomotion.

AB Digitalization of work processes is advancing, and this is increasingly supported by complex information systems (IS). However, whether such systems are used by employees largely depends on users' trust in these IS. Because there are few systematic studies on this topic, this research provides an initial exploration and validation of preconditions for trust in work-related IS. In Study 1, N =30 professionals were asked to describe occupational incidents in which they had highly trusted or distrusted an IS. Content analysis of 111 critical incidents described in the in-depth interviews led to 12 predictors of trust and distrust in IS, which partly correspond to the structure of the established IS success model (Delone & McLean, 2003) but also exceed this structure. The resulting integrative model of trust in IS at work was validated in Study 2 using an online questionnaire with N = 179 professionals. Based on regression analyses, reliability (system quality) and credibility (information quality) of IS were identified as the most important predictors for both trust and distrust in IS at work. Contrasting analyses revealed diverging qualities of trust and distrust in IS : whereas well-being and performance were rated higher in trust events, experienced strain was rated higher in distrust events. Together, this study offers a first comprehensive model of trust in IS at work based on systematic empirical research. In addition to implications for theory advancement, we suggest practical implications for how to support trust and to avoid distrust in IS at work.

AB Background: The inclusion of high-dimensional omics data in prediction models has become a well-studied topic in the last decades. Although most of these methods do not account for possibly different types of variables in the set of covariates available in the same dataset, there are many such scenarios where the variables can be structured in blocks of different types, e.g., clinical, transcriptomic, and methylation data. To date, there exist a few computationally intensive approaches that make use of block structures of this kind.
   Results: In this paper we present priority-Lasso, an intuitive and practical analysis strategy for building prediction models based on Lasso that takes such block structures into account. It requires the definition of a priority order of blocks of data. Lasso models are calculated successively for every block and the fitted values of every step are included as an offset in the fit of the next step. We apply priority-Lasso in different settings on an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) dataset consisting of clinical variables, cytogenetics, gene mutations and expression variables, and compare its performance on an independent validation dataset to the performance of standard Lasso models.
   Conclusion: The results show that priority-Lasso is able to keep pace with Lasso in terms of prediction accuracy. Variables of blocks with higher priorities are favored over variables of blocks with lower priority, which results in easily usable and transportable models for clinical practice.

AB Learning Ising or Potts models from data has become an important topic in statistical physics and computational biology, with applications to predictions of structural contacts in proteins and other areas of biological data analysis. The corresponding inference problems are challenging since the normalization constant (partition function) of the Ising or Potts distribution cannot be computed efficiently on large instances. Different ways to address this issue have resulted in a substantial amount of methodological literature. In this paper we investigate how these methods could be used on much larger data sets than studied previously. We focus on a central aspect, that in practice these inference problems are almost always severely under-sampled, and the operational result is almost always a small set of leading predictions. We therefore explore an approach where the data are prefiltered based on empirical correlations, which can be computed directly even for very large problems. Inference is only used on the much smaller instance in a subsequent step of the analysis. We show that in several relevant model classes such a combined approach gives results of almost the same quality as inference on the whole data set. It can therefore provide a potentially very large computational speedup at the price of only marginal decrease in prediction quality. We also show that the results on whole-genome epistatic couplings that were obtained in a recent computation-intensive study can be retrieved by our approach. The method of this paper hence opens up the possibility to learn parameters describing pairwise dependences among whole genomes in a computationally feasible and expedient manner.

AB Background: Due to the high transfer ability of cancer cell, cancer has been regarded as a world-wide high mortality disease. Quantitative analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can provide some valuable clinical information that is particularly critical for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Along with the rapid development of micro-/nano-fabrication technique, the three-dimensional (3D) bionic interface-based analysis method has become a hot research topic in the area of nanotechnology and life science. Micro-/nano-structure-based devices have been identified as being one of the easiest and most effective techniques for CTCs capture applications.
   Methods: We demonstrated an electrospun nanofibers-deposited nickel (Ni) micropillars-based cytosensor for electrochemical detection of CTCs. Breast cancer cell line with rich EpCAM expression (MCF7) were selected as model CTCs. The ultra-long poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanofibers were firstly-crosswise stacked onto the surface of Ni micropillars by electrospinning to construct a 3D bionic interface for capturing EpCAM-expressing CTCs, following immuno-recognition with quantum dots functionalized anti-EpCAM antibody (QDs-Ab) and forming immunocomplexes on the micro-/nano-chip.
   Results: The Ni micropillars in the longitudinal direction not only play a certain electrical conductivity in the electrochemical detection, but also its special structure improves the efficiency of cell capture. The cross-aligned nanofibers could simulate the extracellular matrix to provide a good microenvironment which is better for cell adhesion and physiological functions. Bioprobe containing quantum dots will release Cd2+ in the process of acid dissolution, resulting in a change in current. Beneath favourable conditions, the suggested 3D cytosensor demonstrated high sensitivity with a broad range of 10(1)-10(5) cells mL(-1) and a detection limit of 8 cells mL(-1).
   Conclusions: We constructed a novel 3D electrochemical cytosensor based on Ni micropillars, PLGA electrospun nanofibers and quantum dots bioprobe, which could be used to highly sensitive and selective analysis of CTCs. More significantly, the 3D cytosensor can efficiently identify CTCs from whole blood, which suggested the potential applications of our technique for the clinical diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of cancers.

   Counseling of Patients Undergoing Hip Arthroscopy

DT Article
DE arthroscopic hip surgery; femoroacetabular impingement; haptic

ID FEMOROACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT; PREVALENCE
AB Background: Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) represents complex alterations in the bony morphology of the proximal femur and acetabulum. Imaging studies have become crucial in diagnosis and treatment planning for symptomatic FAI but also have limited patient understanding and satisfaction. Exploration of alternative patient counseling modalities holds promise for improved patient understanding, satisfaction, and ultimately for outcomes.
   Purpose: To compare perceived understanding of functional anatomy and FAI pathomorphology among patients counseled with routine computed tomography (CT), generic hip models, and a 3-dimensional (3D) model printed in accordance with a patient's specific anatomy.
   Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.
   Methods: A prospective randomized analysis of patients presenting with radiographically confirmed FAI was conducted between November 2015 and April 2017. Patients were randomized into groups that received preoperative counseling with CT imaging alone, a generic human hip model, or a haptic 3D model of their hip. All groups were subjected to a novel questionnaire examining patient satisfaction and understanding on a variety of topics related to FAI. Data were compared with bivariate and multivariate analyses. Statistical significance was determined as P < .05.
   Results: Thirty-one patients were included in this study (25 men, 6 women). Ten patients were randomized to the CT-only group, 11 to the generic hip model group, and 10 to receive custom 3D-printed models of their hips. Patients preoperatively counseled with isolated CT imaging or a generic hip model reported greater understanding of their pathophysiology and the role of surgical intervention when compared with those counseled with haptic 3D models (P = .03). At final follow-up, patients counseled with the use of isolated CT imaging or haptic 3D models reported greater increases and retention of understanding as compared with those counseled with generic hip models alone (P = .03).
   Conclusion: Preoperative counseling with haptic 3D hip models does not appear to favorably affect patient-reported understanding or satisfaction with regard to FAI when compared with the use of CT imaging alone. Continued research into alternative counseling means may serve to further improve patient understanding and satisfaction on this complex anatomic phenomenon.

AB Hereditary retinal degenerations result from varied pathophysiologic mechanisms, all ultimately characterized by photoreceptor dysfunction and death. Hence, much research on these diseases has concentrated on the outer retina. Over the past decade or so increasing attention has focused on concomitant changes in complex inner retinal neural circuits that process visual signals for transmission to the brain. One striking abnormality develops before the ultimately profound anatomic disruption of the inner retina. Highly elevated spontaneous activity was first demonstrated in central nervous system visual centers in vivo by Drager and Hubel (1978), and subsequently has been confirmed in vitro, now in multiple animal models and by multiple investigators (see other contributions to this Research Topic). What evidence exists that this phenomenon occurs in human patients with retinal degeneration, and what is the ultimate effect of spontaneous hyperactivity in the output neurons, the retinal ganglion cells? Here I summarize abnormalities of visual perception among patients with retinal degeneration that may arise from hyperactivity. Next, I consider the disruption of neural encoding and anatomic connectivity that may result within the retina and in downstream visual centers of the brain. I then consider how specific characteristics of hyperactivity may distinguish various forms or stages of retinal degeneration, potentially helping in the near future to refine diagnosis and/or treatment choices for different patients. Finally, I review how consideration of these features may help optimize pharmacologic, gene, stem cell, prosthetic or other therapies to forestall visual loss or restore sight.

AB In response to external stimuli, naive B cells proliferate and take on a range of fates important for immunity. How their fate is determined is a topic of much recent research, with candidates including asymmetric cell division, lineage priming, stochastic assignment, and microenvironment instruction. Here we manipulate the generation of plasmablasts from B lymphocytes in vitro by varying CD40 stimulation strength to determine its influence on potential sources of fate control. Using long-term live cell imaging, we directly measure times to differentiate, divide, and die of hundreds of pairs of sibling cells. These data reveal that while the allocation of fates is significantly altered by signal strength, the proportion of siblings identified with asymmetric fates is unchanged. In contrast, we find that plasmablast generation is enhanced by slowing times to divide, which is consistent with a hypothesis of competing timed stochastic fate outcomes. We conclude that this mechanistically simple source of alternative fate regulation is important, and that useful quantitative models of signal integration can be developed based on its principles.

AB In medical and health studies, longitudinal and cluster longitudinal data are often collected, where the response variable of interest is observed repeatedly over time and along with a set of covariates. Model selection becomes an active research topic but has not been explored largely due to the complex correlation structure of the data set. To address this important issue, in this paper, we concentrate on model selection of cluster longitudinal data especially when data are subject to missingness. Motivated from the expected weighted quadratic loss of a given model, data perturbation and bootstrapping methods are used to estimate the loss and then the model that has the smallest expected loss is selected as the best model. To justify the proposed model selection method, we provide various numerical assessments and a real application regarding the asthma data set is also analyzed for illustration.

AB A common feature of water close to nonpolar particles, at hydrophobic interfaces, and at the surface to its vapor is the signature of ice-like orientated water molecules. By forming ice-like orientations, the number of unsatisfied hydrogen bonds is minimized and thus the energetic penalty is reduced. To what extent these structural motifs correspond to the existence of a real ice layer has been a long-lasting controversial topic, and the view emerges that the solvation layer is only poorly described as being ice. In this work we present new insight into the ice-like conformations of water at a hydrophobic interface by a detailed analysis of molecular dynamics simulations of water at a hydrophobic self-assembled monolayer under pressures from 1 bar up to 10 kbar. We show by analyzing the ice-like order on different length scales that - despite different signatures of ice-like order - the actual density of ice-like structures is negligible at ambient pressure, but significantly grows with increasing pressure contrary to bulk hexagonal ice, which is destabilized by elevated pressure. At 10 kbar, the interfacial water is of significantly ice-like order.

AB Cooperation is a central topic in evolutionary biology because (a) it is difficult to reconcile why individuals would act in a way that benefits others if such action is costly to themselves, and (b) it underpins many of the 'major transitions of evolution', making it essential for explaining the origins of successively higher levels of biological organization. Within evolutionary game theory, the Prisoner's Dilemma and Snowdrift games are the main theoretical constructs used to study the evolution of cooperation in dyadic interactions. In single-shot versions of these games, wherein individuals play each other only once, players typically act simultaneously rather than sequentially. Allowing one player to respond to the actions of its co-player-in the absence of any possibility of the responder being rewarded for cooperation or punished for defection, as in simultaneous or sequential iterated games-may seem to invite more incentive for exploitation and retaliation in single-shot games, compared to when interactions occur simultaneously, thereby reducing the likelihood that cooperative strategies can thrive. To the contrary, I use lattice-based, evolutionary-dynamical simulation models of single-shot games to demonstrate that under many conditions, sequential interactions have the potential to enhance unilaterally or mutually cooperative outcomes and increase the average payoff of populations, relative to simultaneous interactions-benefits that are especially prevalent in a spatially explicit context. This surprising result is attributable to the presence of conditional strategies that emerge in sequential games that can't occur in the corresponding simultaneous versions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Childhood obesity prevention interventions have engaged coalitions in study design, implementation, and/or evaluation to improve research outcomes; yet, no systematic reviews have been conducted on this topic. This mixed methods review aims to characterize the processes and dynamics of coalition engagement in community-based childhood obesity prevention interventions.
   Methods: Data Sources: Studies extracted from Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, and Web of Science; complementary original survey and interview data among researchers of included studies. Eligible Studies: Multisetting community-based obesity prevention interventions in high-income countries targeting children 0-12 years with anthropometric, behavioral, or environmental/policy outcomes. The Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) Conceptual Model was used as an overarching framework.
   Results: Thirteen studies met inclusion criteria. Elements of CBPR were evident across all studies with community engagement in problem identification (n=7), design/planning (n=11), implementation (n=12), evaluation (n=4), dissemination (n=2), and sustainability (n=10) phases. Five studies reported favorable intervention effects on anthropometric (n=4), behavioral (n=1), and/or policy (n=1) outcomes; descriptive associations suggested that these studies tended to engage community members in a greater number of research phases. Researchers involved in 7 of 13 included studies completed a survey and interview. Respondents recalled the importance of group facilitation, leadership, and shared understanding to multisector coalition work. Perceived coalition impacts included community capacity building and intervention sustainability.
   Conclusions: This review contributes to a deeper understanding of intervention processes and dynamics within communities engaged in childhood obesity prevention. Future research should more rigorously assess and report on coalition involvement to assess the influence of coalitions on multiple outcomes, including child weight status.

AB To meet the rising demands for safety and reliability of modern industrial control systems, the modelbased fault diagnosis problem has attracted much attention in the past few decades both from the academic communities and in practical applications. Among the rich body of literature, the majority of the results are proposed for linear time invariant systems despite the fact that most practical processes are inherently time-varying by nature and discretized for online implementations. Recently, with the everincreasing system complexity and scale, the model-based fault diagnosis issue for linear discrete timevarying ( LDTV) systems has become a hot research topic of both theoretical importance and practical significance, and a great number of results have been reported with many open problems deserving further investigation. To reflect the latest progress in this emerging research branch, this survey aims to provide a timely reference to readers interested in this topic. More specifically, in this survey, the techniques for model-based fault diagnosis for LDTV systems are classified into observer-based methods, parity space-based approaches and parameter estimation schemes, which constitute the three main parts of this survey. The background and the latest progress for each class of these techniques are comparatively discussed with particular focuses on the fault detection and the fault estimation issues. Additionally, an overview on their practical applications to specific industrial plants is provided. Furthermore, the possible future research directions concerning the model-based fault diagnosis for LDTV processes are pointed out, followed by comprehensive concluding remarks.

AB The atomic-level structure of metallic glasses (MGs) is one of the most fundamental and challenging topics in condensed matter physics. Unlike crystalline metals or alloys, the MGs are lacking in a well-defined description of structure order, which is a major obstruction for relating its structure to physical properties. Obviously, it is vitally important to have an in-depth understanding of the atomic packing scheme in MGs. Due to the limitations of experimental characterization methods, it is hard to obtain the atomic packing scheme of MGs in experiment. Computational simulation on an atomic scale has become an important method of characterizing the atomic structure of MGs. The La-based La-Ni-Al glass forming system is well-known for its good glass-forming ability, distinctive alpha relaxation peak that is well separated from beta relaxation, and liquid-liquid transition at a temperature around 1000 K. Many efforts have been made to investigate these novel properties. However, the atomic structure of this system is rarely studied. In this paper, the atomic structure evolution from liquids to glass states in La-based binary MGs La65Ni35 and La65Al35 are studied via ab initio molecular dynamics based on the density functional theory. The local structures are systematically analyzed by the radical distribution function, partial radical distribution function (PRDF), Voronoi tessellation method, and bond-type method in Honeycutt-Andersen. The results indicate that the PRDF of Ni-Ni is much weaker than that of Al-Al, which indicates the Ni-Ni avoidance in La65Ni35. The major peaks of PRDFs are always smaller than the sum of efficient radius of the two kinds of atoms, especially for La-Ni pairs. Atomic structure of the two systems are coincident with dense atomic packing scheme and the difference between major Voronoi polyhedron types (< 0; 3; 6; 0 > for La65Ni35 and < 0, 2, 8, 1 >, < 0, 2, 8, 0 > for La65Al35) in local structures is controlled by their ratio of solute to solvent atomic size. The high five-fold local symmetry structure gradually increases in both systems with the decrease of temperature, which validates its pivotal part in hindering crystallization. The electronic structure is studied with the partial density of states. It is found that the significant bond-shortening between La and Ni is due to the strong hybridization between Ni-3d and La-5d electrons and this result may play a key role in understanding composition related structure and properties in MGs.

AB Background: The objective was to explore the current advances and extent of DES ( Discrete Event Simulation) applied to assisting with health decision making, as well as to categorize the wide spectrum of health-related topics where DES was applied.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted of the literature published over the last two decades. Original research articles were included and reviewed if they concentrated on the topic of DES technique applied to health care management with model frameworks explicitly demonstrated. No restriction regarding the settings of DES application was applied.
   Results: A total of 211 papers met the predefined inclusion criteria. The number of publications included increased significantly especially after 2010.101 papers (48%) stated explicitly disease areas targeted, the most frequently modeled of which are related to circulatory system, nervous system and Neoplasm. The DES applications were distributed unevenly into 4 major classes: health and care systems operation (HCSO) (65%), disease progression modeling (DPM) (28%), screening modeling (SM) (5%) and health behavior modeling (HBM) (2%). More than 68% of HCSO by DES were focused on specific problems in individual units. However, more attempts at modeling highly integrated health service systems as well as some new trends were identified.
   Conclusions: DES technique has been an effective tool to approach a wide variety of health care issues. Among all DES applications in health care, health system operations research occupied the most considerable proportion and increased most significantly. Health Economic Evaluation (HEE) was the second most common topic for DES in health care, but with stable rather than increasing numbers of publications.

AB Identifying biomarkers for major depression is of high importance for improving diagnosis and treatment of this common and debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder, as the field seeks to move toward both personalized and more effective treatments. Here we focus on electroencephalography (EEG) or direct scalp voltage recordings as such a biomarker, with an emphasis on gamma and high gamma oscillations (or "rhythms"). In the last several decades, alpha and theta band rhythms have been found to provide information on depressive state as well as recovery, but the gamma band is less well characterized with respect to depression. We summarize some key findings on gamma rhythms (especially their amplitude) as a biomarker or endophenotype for major depression. These studies suggest: (1) under certain conditions gamma rhythms can distinguish subjects with major depression from healthy controls, (2) gamma may distinguish bipolar disorder from unipolar depression, (3) various pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments that counteract depression also alter gamma, (4) animal models of depression-like behavior show gamma abnormalities, with changes in gamma associated with therapeutic recovery. The most informative approaches in the future may combine profiles of gamma band power across the brain to assess ratios of activity across regions. Overall we have good evidence to suggest that gamma rhythms may provide objective information on major depressive disease status, but we will need further work to better define the precise measures to follow.

AB Aims: Cardiac dysfunction can be a fatal complication during severe sepsis. The migration of neutrophils is significantly impaired during severe sepsis. We sought to determine the role of trimetazidine (TMZ) in regulation of neutrophil migration to the heart in a mouse model of sepsis and endotoxemia, and to identify the mechanism whereby TMZ confers a survival advantage.
   Methods and Results: C57/BL6 mice were (1) injected with LPS followed by 24-h TMZ administration, or (2) treated with TMZ (20 mg/kg/day) for 1 week post cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) operation. Echocardiography and Millar system detection showed that TMZ alleviated cardiac dysfunction and histological staining showed the failure of neutrophils migration to heart in both LPS- and CLP-induced mice. Bone marrow transplantation revealed that TMZ-pretreated bone marrow cells improved LPS- and CLP-induced myocardial dysfunction and enhanced neutrophil recruitment in heart. In CXCL2-mediated chemotaxis assays, TMZ increased neutrophils migration via AMPK/Nrf2-dependent up-regulation of CXCR2 and inhibition of GRK2. Furthermore, using luciferase reporter gene and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we found that TMZ promoted the binding of the Nrf2 and CXCR2 promoter regions directly. Application of CXCR2 inhibitor completely reversed the protective effects of TMZ in vivo. Co-culture of neutrophils and cardiomyocytes further validated that TMZ decreased LPS-induced cardiomyocyte pyroptosis by targeting neutrophils.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggested TMZ as a potential therapeutic agent for septic or endotoxemia associated cardiac dysfunction in mice.
   STUDY HIGHLIGHTS
   What is the current knowledge on the topic?
   Migration of neutrophils is significantly impaired during severe sepsis, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.
   What question did this study address?
   The effects of TMZ on cardiac dysfunction via neutrophils migration.
   What this study adds to our knowledge
   TMZ attenuated LPS-induced cardiomyocyte pyroptosis and cardiac dysfunction by promoting neutrophils recruitment to the heart tissues via CXCR2.
   How this might change clinical pharmacology or translational science
   Our findings suggested TMZ as a potential therapeutic agent for septic cardiac dysfunction.

AB Static compression experiments over 4 Mbar are rare, yet critical for developing accurate fundamental physics and chemistry models, relevant to a range of topics including modeling planetary interiors. Here we show that focused ion beam crafted toroidal single-crystal diamond anvils with similar to 9.0 mu m culets are capable of producing pressures over 5 Mbar. The toroidal surface prevents gasket outflow and provides a means to stabilize the central culet. We have reached a maximum pressure of similar to 6.15 Mbar using Re as in situ pressure marker, a pressure regime typically accessed only by double-stage diamond anvils and dynamic compression platforms. Optimizing single-crystal diamond anvil design is key for extending the pressure range over which studies can be performed in the diamond anvil cell.

AB Background: Bacterial growth is an important topic in microbiology and of crucial importance to better understand living cells. Bacterial growth dynamics are quantitatively examined using various methods to determine the physical, chemical or biological features of growing populations. Due to methodological differences, the exponential growth rate, which is a parameter that is representative of growth dynamics, should be differentiated. Ignoring such differentiation in the growth analysis might overlook somehow slight but significant changes in cellular features of the growing population. Both experimental and theoretical investigations are required to address these issues.
   Results: This study experimentally verified the differentiation in growth rates attributed to different methodologies, and demonstrated that the most popular method, optical turbidity, led to the determination of a lower growth rate in comparison to the methods based on colony formation and cellular adenosine triphosphate, due to a decay effect of reading OD600 during a population increase. Accordingly, the logistic model, which is commonly applied to the high-throughput growth data reading the OD600, was revised by introducing a new parameter: the decay rate, to compensate for the lowered estimation in growth rates. An improved goodness of fit in comparison to the original model was acquired due to this revision. Applying the modified logistic model to hundreds of growth data acquired from an assortment of Escherichia coli strains carrying the reduced genomes led to an intriguing finding of a correlation between the decay rate and the genome size. The decay effect seemed to be partially attributed to the decrease in cell size accompanied by a population increase and was medium dependent.
   Conclusions: The present study provides not only an improved theoretical tool for the high-throughput studies on bacterial growth dynamics linking with optical turbidity to biological meaning, but also a novel insight of the genome reduction correlated decay effect which potentially reflects the changing cellular features during population increase. It is valuable for understanding the genome evolution and the fitness increase in microbial life.

AB In the past few years, soft robotics has rapidly become an emerging research topic, opening new possibilities for addressing real-world tasks. Perception can enable robots to effectively explore the unknown world, and interact safely with humans and the environment. Among all extero- and proprioception modalities, the detection of mechanical cues is vital, as with living beings. A variety of soft sensing technologies are available today, but there is still a gap to effectively utilize them in soft robots for practical applications. Here, the developments in soft robots with mechanical sensing are summarized to provide a comprehensive understanding of the state of the art in this field. Promising sensing technologies for mechanically perceptive soft robots are described, categorized, and their pros and cons are discussed. Strategies for designing soft sensors and criteria to evaluate their performance are outlined from the perspective of soft robotic applications. Challenges and trends in developing multimodal sensors, stretchable conductive materials and electronic interfaces, modeling techniques, and data interpretation for soft robotic sensing are highlighted. The knowledge gap and promising solutions toward perceptive soft robots are discussed and analyzed to provide a perspective in this field.

AB Against the backdrop of only a few empirical studies on the topic of up-or-out career models in professional service firms (PSFs), we highlight the importance of an explicit applicant perspective on the topic of up-or-out and develop a quantitative approach to analyze the perception and effects of up-or-out models in practice. Our empirical study is based on an online practitioner survey as well as on a two-by-two between-subjects-experiment with law and management students. The practitioner sample shows that the interviewed classic PSFs (law firms and accounting firms) have predominantly implemented alternative career positions in favor of up-or-out models while the interviewed Neo-PSFs (management consulting firms) show a more balanced implementation of up-or-out models and extended career models. However, results of our experimental applicant study reveal that the potential employee groups have different preferences: Law students (and hence potential applicants of classic PSFs in the future) show a higher likelihood to apply in connection with the up-or-out-model, whereas management students (and hence potential applicants of Neo-PSFs in the future) show a higher likelihood to apply in connection with the alternative career model.

AB This paper presents a novel system, synthetic high-fidelity social media data generator (SHIELD), for generating the synthetic social media data. SHIELD jointly generates time-varying, directed and weighted interaction graph structures and topic-driven text features similar to the input social media data. A synthetic interaction graph is generated by a social network model to minimize the distance to real graph and is enhanced by adding various patterns, such as anomalies and information cascades, interaction types, and temporal dynamics. A synthetic text generator based on the n-gram Markov model is trained under each topic identified by topic modeling. Synthetic text and graph structures are combined through the assignment of synthetic social media entities. Extensive performance evaluation via a graph and text analysis is provided to demonstrate the statistical fidelity of large-scale synthetic data generated by SHIELD. A data evaluation exercise with human participants is executed to identify how difficult it is for a human to distinguish between tweets that were generated by SHIELD and tweets that were posted by real users. Experimental results followed by a statistical significance analysis showed that human participants cannot reliably distinguish between real and synthetic tweets.

ID CENTRALITY; DIFFUSION; INFORMATION; ATTENTION; MODEL
AB One highly studied topic in the field of social networks is the search for influential nodes that, when seeded (i.e., activated intentionally), may further activate a large portion of the network through a viral contagion process. Indeed, various mathematical models were proposed in the literature to characterize the dynamics of such diffusion processes, and different solutions were suggested for maximizing influence under such models. However, most of these solutions focused on selecting a set of nodes to be seeded at the initial phase of the diffusion process. This paper suggests a scheduled seeding approach that aims at finding not only the best set of nodes to be seeded but also the right timing to perform these seedings. More specifically, we identify three different properties of existing contagion models that can be utilized by a scheduled approach to improve the total number of activated nodes: 1) stochastic dynamics; 2) diminishing social effect; and 3) state-dependent seeding. By analyzing each of these properties separately, we demonstrate the advantages of the scheduled seeding approach over the traditional initial seeding approach, both by theoretical and empirical evaluation. Our analysis presents an improvement of 10%-70% in the final number of infected nodes when using the scheduled seeding approach. Our findings have the potential to open up a new area of research, focusing on finding the right timing for seeding actions, thereby helping both in improving our understanding of information diffusion dynamics and in devising better strategies for influence maximization.

AB Performance enhancement of refrigeration and heat pump systems by cycle modification is an emerging research topic now-a-days to reduce the electricity consumption leading to mitigate the problems related to the environmental pollution by utility power plants. Due to no moving parts, low cost, simple structure and low maintenance requirements, the use of two-phase ejector has become a promising cycle modification recently. Use of ejector as an expansion device by replacing the throttle valve in the vapor compression refrigeration cycle seems to be one of the efficient ways to reduce the throttling losses or the expansion irreversibility in the refrigeration/heat pump cycle. Ejector also reduces the compressor work by raising the suction pressure to a level higher than that in the evaporator leading to the improvement of COP. The present work aims to evaluate the performance of an ejector based vapor compression refrigeration cycle under a wide range of operating conditions. Two newly proposed refrigerants i.e., R1234yf and R1234ze, and commonly used refrigerant R134a are considered for simulation and a comparative study has been carried out. A numerical model is developed and a parametric study of important parameters such as entrainment ratio, high side pressure (condenser pressure) and evaporator temperature are analyzed for the improvement of COP of the system. Results show that the COP of the R1234ze is highest compared to R1234yf and R134a for the given evaporating and condensing temperature.

AB Cosmetics are primarily applied to the skin; therefore, the association of cosmetic dyes with skin diseases or inflammation is a topic of great interest. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an interleukin 7-like cytokine that activates dendritic cells to promote Th2 inflammatory immune responses. TSLP is highly expressed in keratinocytes under inflammatory conditions, which suggests that it may play a critical role in the development of skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis. Therefore, we investigated whether cosmetic dyes influenced the production of TSLP by keratinocytes. Phloxine O, also known as D&C Red No.27, is one of the most common red synthetic pigments and is widely used in colored cosmetics. Our results showed that Phloxine O downregulated phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced production of TSLP in a murine keratinocyte cell line (PAM212). Phloxine O also suppressed TSLP expression in KCMH-1 cells, which are mouse keratinocytes that constitutively produce high levels of TSLP. To investigate the in vivo effects of Phloxine O, we induced TSLP expression in mouse ear skin by topically applying MC903, a vitamin D3 analogue that is a well-known inducer of atopic dermatitis-like symptoms. Topical application of Phloxine O prevented MC903-induced TSLP production in mouse ear skin, attenuated the acute dermatitis-like symptoms and decreased serum IgE and histamine levels in mice. Suppression of TSLP expression by Phloxine O correlated with reduced expression of OX40 ligand and Th2 cytokines in mouse ear skin. Our results showed that Phloxine O may be beneficial to prevent dermatitis by suppressing the expression of TSLP and Th2 cytokines in skin.

AB With the irruption of inexpensive depth sensor devices, hand gesture tracking has become a topic of great interest. Two main problems to face respect other tracking algorithms are the high complexity of the hand structure, which translate in a very large amount of possible gestures, and the rapidness of the movements we are able to make when moving the hand or just the fingers. Recent approaches try to fit a 3D hand model to the observed RGB-D data by an optimization function that minimizes the error between the model and the data. However, these algorithms are very dependent on the initialization point, which are impractical to run in a natural environment. To solve these kinds of problems, it is common to use an offline data set with prelearned gestures that will serve as a first rough estimate. In concrete, we present an algorithm that uses an articulated ICP minimization function that is initialized by the parameters obtained from a data set of hand gestures trained through a deep learning framework. This setup has two strong points. First, deep learning provides a very fast and accurate estimate of performed hand gestures. Second, the articulated ICP algorithm allows capturing the possible variability of a gesture performed by different persons or slightly different gestures. Our proposed algorithm is evaluated and validated in several ways. Independent evaluations for the deep learning framework and articulated ICP are performed. Moreover, different real sequences are recorded to validate our approach and, finally, quantitative and qualitative comparisons are conducted with state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB Multimedia retrieval plays an indispensable role in big data utilization. Past efforts mainly focused on single-media retrieval. However, the requirements of users are highly flexible, such as retrieving the relevant audio clips with one query of image. So challenges stemming from the "media gap," which means that representations of different media types are inconsistent, have attracted increasing attention. Cross-media retrieval is designed for the scenarios where the queries and retrieval results are of different media types. As a relatively new research topic, its concepts, methodologies, and benchmarks are still not clear in the literature. To address these issues, we review more than 100 references, give an overview including the concepts, methodologies, major challenges, and open issues, as well as build up the benchmarks, including data sets and experimental results. Researchers can directly adopt the benchmarks to promptly evaluate their proposed methods. This will help them to focus on algorithm design, rather than the time-consuming compared methods and results. It is noted that we have constructed a new data set XMedia, which is the first publicly available data set with up to five media types (text, image, video, audio, and 3-D model). We believe this overview will attract more researchers to focus on cross-media retrieval and be helpful to them.

AB The topic of migration, flight and trauma is as old as civilization, as its myths, fairytales, and its legends such as "The Odyssey" and well-known literary figures like Oedipus and Medea (first section of the paper). However, the current refugee crisis in Europe has led to societal tensions and even splitting among large groups, such as in Germany where enormous empathy for the refugees' plight can be observed on the one hand, and hostilities, anxiety and xenophobic feelings and actions on the other hand. In the second section of the paper, the authors summarize some of the psychoanalytical concepts trying to understand some of the unconscious roots of xenophobia, antisemitism, fundamentalism and nationalism. Another psychoanalytical contribution in support of refugees comes from the body of psychoanalytic and interdisciplinary research on trauma and its transgenerational transmission (third section). Therewith psychoanalysis has produced a large conceptual, research and clinical knowledge base, which we may consider to be one of the contributions of psychoanalysis to current interdisciplinary and public discourse on refugees and immigrants. In the last section of this paper the authors summarize the pilot project STEP-BY-STEP which was carried out from January 2016 until April 2017 in a first reception center in Darmstadt. Concepts, applications and clinical experiences are presented for discussion. The pilot project has been quite successful and is serving as a model to be implemented during the next five years by four Psychosocial Centers for supporting refugees in Hesse. Given the large problems society faces in response to the "Refugee Crisis", the authors consider their labors a mere drop in the endless ocean of pain, despair and sufferings of thousands of refugees who have escaped war, terror and poverty in their home countries and are hoping for a better life in Europe and elsewhere.

AB Topic modeling is a mainstream and effective technology to deal with text data, with wide applications in text analysis, natural language, personalized recommendation, computer vision, etc. Among all the known topic models, supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (sLDA) is acknowledged as a popular and competitive supervised topic model. However, the gradual increase of the scale of datasets makes sLDA more and more inefficient and time-consuming, and limits its applications in a very narrow range. To solve it, a parallel online sLDA, named PO-sLDA (Parallel and Online sLDA), is proposed in this study. It uses the stochastic variational inference as the learning method to make the training procedure more rapid and efficient, and a parallel computing mechanism implemented via the MapReduce framework is proposed to promote the capacity of cloud computing and big data processing. The online training capacity supported by PO-sLDA expands the application scope of this approach, making it instrumental for real-life applications with high real-time demand. The validation using two datasets with different sizes shows that the proposed approach has the comparative accuracy as the sLDA and can efficiently accelerate the training procedure. Moreover, its good convergence and online training capacity make it lucrative for the large-scale text data analyzing and processing.

AB The STARTS (Stable Trait, AutoRegressive Trait, and State) model decomposes individual differences in psychological measurement across time into 3 sources of variation: a time-invariant stable component, a time-varying autoregressive component, and an occasion-specific state component. Previous simulation research and applications of the STARTS model have shown that serious estimation problems such as nonconvergence or inadmissible estimates (e.g., negative variances) frequently occur for STARTS model parameters. This article introduces a general approach to estimating the parameters of the STARTS model by employing Bayesian methods that use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. With the specification of appropriate prior distributions, the Bayesian approach offers the advantage that the model estimates will be within the admissible range, and it should be possible to avoid estimation problems. Furthermore, we show how Bayesian methods can be used to stabilize STARTS model estimates by specifying weakly informative prior distributions for the model parameters. In a simulation study, the statistical properties (bias, root mean square error, coverage rate) of the parameter estimates obtained from the Bayesian approach are compared with those of the maximum-likelihood approach. A data example is presented to illustrate how the Bayesian approach can be used to estimate the STARTS model. Finally, further extensions of the STARTS model are discussed, and suggestions for applied research are made.
   Translational Abstract
   Studying stability and change in psychological constructs (e.g., self-esteem, depression) across time is a central topic of longitudinal research. The STARTS (Stable Trait, AutoRegressive Trait, and State) model offers great potential for researchers interested in the question which portion of individual differences across time in a psychological construct is explained by stable factors that are completely unchanging across time (e.g., genes), which portion is due to the effects of changing factors that are only partly stable and endure across time (e.g., relationship satisfaction), and which portion reflects the effects of transient factors that are completely occasion specific (e.g., mood). Previous research has revealed that the applicability of the STARTS model is limited by the fact that large data sets with many measurement points are needed to obtain valid estimates of the model parameters. In this article, we demonstrate that a Bayesian estimation approach has the potential to solve some of these estimation problems (e.g., variances that are negative). The basic idea of the proposed Bayesian approach is to add a small amount of information to the model that provides some direction for the estimation of the model parameters. It is shown with simulated and real data that compared to previous estimation approaches (e.g., maximum likelihood estimation), the Bayesian approach needs less demanding longitudinal designs in order to obtain reliable estimates of STARTS model parameters. We hope that the proposed approach allows for better understanding of stability and change in psychological constructs across time.

AB Social science journals are undergoing a process of change to reach the quality standards required by knowledge assessment agencies. This paper presents an overview of the main areas requiring improvement in order to attain a better position, visibility, and impact for these journals. Considering its remarkable trajectory that makes it a reference in the field of social sciences, the model of the journal Comunicar is analysed, pondering the relationship between articles received and accepted, authorship, methodologies, and quality criteria employed by the journal. This piece concludes with a reflection on the existence of a new academic culture, the potential quality parameters of the journals and their indicators, the importance of the author of academic texts and his or her training, the establishment of topics of interest beyond the local or individual, visibility and transference, and the incorporation of new ways of measuring the impact of work, in line with the resources of the digital society.

AB Academic journals play an essential role in the dissemination and preservation of knowledge as well as giving due recognition to the researcher. This is a means of communication which has barely changed over the last few centuries, with the academic community recognizing the basic traits it had to fulfil. Since the end of the 20th century we have witnessed a radical transformation of these publications owing to decisions in academic policy, processes for evaluating the professional development of researchers, and the possibilities that the digital environment has created for releasing these publications.
   Based on content analysis of the main research into this topic, the position of academic journals is analysed, with special emphasis on ones from the field of social sciences. The especially precarious situation these find themselves in and the urgency of incorporating international quality standards with the aim of being indexed in the most important databases are considered. At the same time, the challenges currently faced relating to necessary transformation to the digital environment are addressed. Accessibility, open access, new resources such as added value, business models, impact measurement, and behavioural changes in researchers are issues considered and reflected on in order to propose actions that will lead to quality publications.
   This new qualitative leap in the publishing of academic journals requires radically different designs, diffusion, and readings, and so we must be able to offer innovative solutions regarding formats, management, dissemination, etc., while at the same time reflecting on the role of academic journals in the development of knowledge in our society.

AB Religious change continues to be a controversial topic that involves both theoretical and methodological issues. As to the European context, the main dispute is between secularization and individualization theory, especially considering the believing without belonging' thesis. This article will tackle this dispute given these three choices: firstly, we assume that cohort replacement is the main driver of religious change; secondly, religious tradition has to be taken fully into account to explain religious change; thirdly, we consider religiosity as a complex phenomenon that requires a multidimensional approach. Results from a multilevel multiple responses model based on EVS (European Values Study) data show that practice is declining across cohorts in all the countries whereas trends for belief and self-definition diverge only for Eastern Orthodox countries. Depending on the interpretation, such exception seems supporting rather than undermining the believing without belonging' theory.

AB Most biofluids are non-Newtonian fluids with complex flow behaviors; for instance, human blood and DNA samples are shear thinning fluids (Jeffery model). The electro-kinetic transport of such fluids by microperistaltic pumping has been a topic of interest in biomedical engineering and other medical fields. This type of fluid transport requires sophisticated mathematical models and numerical simulations. Motivated by these developments, this study analyzed the simultaneous effects of an electric double layer (EDL) and a transverse magnetic field on the peristaltic flow and transport of blood. However, electro-osmotic flow is most significant when in micro channels/tubes. A constitutive relation is proposed to describe the electro-osmotic flow in the gap between two micro-coaxial horizontal pipes. Under low Reynolds number, long wavelength and Debye linearization approximations, the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, and governing equations are derived with the appropriate boundary conditions. The expressions for the electric potential, stream function, axial velocity, shear wall stress, and axial pressure gradient are obtained. The pressure rise and frictional force per wavelength are numerically evaluated and briefly discussed. The computational evidence suggests that the electric potential is an increasing function of the EDL thickness. Additionally, axial flow is accelerated by a positive electric field and decelerated by a negative electric field. Finally, the bolus size is reduced as the axial external electric field changes from the positive to negative direction.

AB The discussion about the status of the translated literary text and the position of the translator is ever-present in the field of Translation Studies. Sensitive issues such as authorship, authorship in translation and the position of the translated text within the receiving literary system keep theoreticians busy, as well as discussions about canon in literature and canon in translated literature. A less evident topic is the existence of canonical translations which are regarded as "definitive" in the receiving literary system or as a model for subsequent translations. I intend to show in this paper that the phenomenon I call canonical translation is neither an isolated phenomenon nor restricts itself to peripheral literary systems.

AB The Eastern Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) represents a geologically complex realm with a tectonic history that is related to the final stages of the formation of the Pangaea supercontinent during the Mesozoic and its subsequent disintegration during the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic. It is a key region to constrain the origin of the deep water basins and intervening ridges of the Amerasia Basin. We present results of gravity modeling of published seismic refraction and reflection profiles acquired between 1989 and 2012 over the ESAS and adjacent Arctic Ocean along five composite geotransects using Getech's satellite altimeter-derived gravity data. Our main goal was to examine published crustal models and to present new models for the ESAS that are constrained by both seismic data and 2D gravity forward modeling. We consider several topics important for understanding Arctic geology: (i) hyperextension within the Laptev Rift System and the possible extent of the exhumed mantle, (ii) the relationship between the New Siberian Shelf and the Lomonosov Ridge, (iii) the nature of the collapsed upper Mesozoic fold belt in the southern part of the East Siberian Sea, (iv) the character of transition between the De Long Massif and the deep-water Podvodnikov Basin, (v) the lateral extent of the hyperextended North Chukchi Basin and the nature of its basement, and (vi) relationship between the Mendeleev Ridge and Chukchi Plateau crustal domains. Our results do not confirm the previously inferred extent of continental crust beneath the oceanic realm. The latter is dominated by High Arctic Large Igneous Province (HALM) igneous crust. We discuss the existence of a dismembered continental Bennett-Barrovia block that is currently represented by three smaller fragments/massifs. When restored to its possible single state, this block can play a crucial role in reconstructing the pre-Canada Basin Arctic.

ID PARADOX
AB Why is it that we respond emotionally to plays, movies, and novels and feel moved by characters and situations that we know do not exist? This question, which constitutes the kernel of the debate on "the paradox of fiction", speaks to the perennial themes of philosophy, and remains of interest to this day. But does this question entail a paradox? A significant group of analytic philosophers have indeed thought so. Since the publication of Colin Radford's celebrated paper "How Can We Be Moved by the Fate of Anna Karenina?" (1975), the number of proposals to solve, explain, reformulate, dismiss or even revitalize this apparent paradox has continued to proliferate. In line with recent developments in the philosophy of emotion, in this paper I will argue against the sustainability of the paradox, claiming that the only reasonable way to continue our discussions about it consists in using it as a heuristic tool to shed light on problems regarding our involvement with fiction. Against this background, I will then focus on one of the problems related to how our emotional responses to fiction contribute to our appreciation of it.
   The paper is divided into three main sections. The first section shows the parallel evolution of the paradox of fiction and the analytic philosophy of emotion. Here I claim that, although the paradox is epistemically flawed, since one of its premises is rooted in a limited view on the emotions typical of early cognitivism, the discussions it provokes are still epistemically useful. As Robert Stecker (2011, 295), among others, has pointed out, the paradox was formulated during the heyday of cognitive theories of the emotions in which emotion necessarily requires belief. Today, however, only few authors would endorse this premise. If emotion does not always require belief (as the majority of authors in the contemporary debate admit), let alone belief about the existence of the object towards which it is directed, then there is no reason to speak of a paradox. From this first conclusion, however, it does not follow that the paradox is completely without use from the epistemic point of view. A glimpse at the topics touched on during the discussions about how to solve, reformulate, or negate the paradox reveals their value in shedding light on the interrelation between emotion and fiction.
   The second section elaborates a phenomenologically inspired cognitive account of the emotions by focusing on their cognitive bases, their influence on cognitions, and their cognitive function. In this model, emotions are responsible for indicating values, for showing what matters to us, and for being appropriate to their objects. My claim is that this view applies not only to reality, but also to our involvement with fiction.
   In the final section I draw on this account to focus on one kind of appreciation of fiction which necessarily requires our emotional involvement. Following an idea put forward by Susan Feagin (1996, 1), I employ the concept of "appreciation" to refer to a set of abilities exercised with the aim of extracting value from the work. There is a long tradition in aesthetics that condemns any focus on the emotions in the appreciation of art and fiction, and defends the necessity of aesthetic appreciation without emotional influence. To refer to this negative attitude towards the emotions, I will borrow an expression coined by Susan Feagin (2013, 636), who refers to "the intellectualized view of appreciation". Against this widespread view, I will argue that some aspects of the fiction can only be appreciated with the help of our emotions. The cognitive approach developed in the previous section can explain how the emotions might in fact play a significant role in the appreciation of art and fiction. Attention will be paid to three activities involved in appreciation, for all of which emotion is crucial: processing relevant information about the fictional world, understanding aspects of it, and becoming acquainted with the values it presents. My aim here is to argue that there are particular aspects of the fictional world that can only be appreciated if recipients have the appropriate emotions.

AB Engineering surface loops is a sub-topic of protein engineering that is used routinely in many research fields in academia and industry alike. We provide some tools that search in the PDB for loops satisfying a wide variety of constraints. We illustrate the usefulness of these tools by applying them to a series of recently published studies that included loop engineering or loop modelling.
   LoopFinder finds loops that fit between two anchor stretches of typically 2, 3, or 4 amino acids each. ProDA find loops of a given length with predefined secondary structure, residue types, hydrophobicity, etc. WHAT IF has gotten a series of new options to scan the whole PDB for loops combining the Loop Finder and ProDA techniques. The open nature of these tools will allow bioinformaticians in this field to easily design their own loop modelling software around our tools.
   Availability and implementation: LoopFinder is a stand-alone Fortran program that is likely to compile and run on every computer. The LoopFinder source code, data files, and documentation are freely available from swift.cmbi.ru.nl/gv/loops/. ProDA is free to all users. There is no login requirement.

AB The randomized response technique (RRT) is a classical and effective method used to mitigate the distortion arising from dishonest answers. The traditional RRT usually focuses on the case of a single sensitive attribute, and discussion of the case of multiple sensitive attributes is limited. Here, we study a business case to identify some individual and organizational determinants driving information systems (IS) resource misuse in the workplace. People who actually engage in IS resource misuse are probably not willing to provide honest answers, given the sensitivity of the topic. Yet, to develop the causal relationship between IS resource misuse and its determinants, a version of the RRT for multivariate analysis is required. To implement the RRT with multiple sensitive attributes, we propose a Bayesian approach for estimating covariance matrices with incomplete information (resulting from the randomization procedure in the RRT case). The proposed approach (i) accommodates the positive definite condition and other intrinsic parameter constraints in the posterior to improve statistical precision, (ii) incorporates Bayesian shrinkage estimation for covariance matrices despite incomplete information, and (iii) adopts a quasi-likelihood method to achieve Bayesian semiparametric inference for enhancing flexibility. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method in a simulation study. We also apply the Bayesian RRT method and structural equation modeling to identify the causal relationship between IS resource misuse and its determinants.

AB Intelligent transport systems, efficient electric grids, and sensor networks for data collection and analysis are some examples of the multiagent systems (MAS) that cooperate to achieve common goals. Decision making is an integral part of intelligent agents and MAS that will allow such systems to accomplish increasingly complex tasks. In this survey, we investigate state-of-the-art work within the past five years on cooperative MAS decision making models, including Markov decision processes, game theory, swarm intelligence, and graph theoretic models. We survey algorithms that result in optimal and suboptimal policies such as reinforcement learning, dynamic programming, evolutionary computing, and neural networks. We also discuss the application of these models to robotics, wireless sensor networks, cognitive radio networks, intelligent transport systems, and smart electric grids. In addition, we define key terms in the area and discuss remaining challenges that include incorporating big data advancements to decision making, developing autonomous, scalable and computationally efficient algorithms, tackling more complex tasks, and developing standardized evaluation metrics. While recent surveys have been published on this topic, we present a broader discussion of related models and applications.

AB One of the important topics in the study of robotic cognition is to enable robot to perceive, plan, and react to situations in a real-world environment. We present a novel angle on this subject, by integrating active navigation with sequence learning. We propose a neuro-inspired cognitive navigation model which integrates the cognitive mapping ability of entorhinal cortex (EC) and episodic memory ability of hippocampus to enable the robot to perform more versatile cognitive tasks. The EC layer is modeled by a 3-D continuous attractor network structure to build the map of the environment. The hippocampus is modeled by a recurrent spiking neural network to store and retrieve task-related information. The information between cognitive map and memory network are exchanged through respective encoding and decoding schemes. The cognitive system is applied on a mobile robot platform and the robot exploration, localization, and navigation are investigated. The robotic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.

AB Nowadays industrial and academic communities are focusing much of their efforts to define the main characteristics of 5G. Cognitive radio (CR), offering the possibility to significantly increase the spectrum efficiency, will play a key role in the whole range of Internet of Things communications (one of the use cases of 5G networks). While CR is one of the most discussed topics in contemporary spectrum management, there are still many issues and challenges to be solved, even more when we think about large networks. In this context, one of the main question that motivates this paper is: how to encourage the spectrum sharing behavior of primary users (PUs)? With this in mind, we study a paid sharing approach where secondary users (SUs) pay for spectrum utilization. We assume a preemptive system where PUs have strict priority over SUs, and the affected SUs will then be reimbursed, implying some cost for the PUs service provider. This paper bears on the analysis of the behavior of the system, where the number of users is arbitrary large and an admission control policy over SUs is applied. We develop a computationally efficient methodology to find an accurate estimation of the optimal admission control boundary based on fluid limits.

The most productive authors, institutions, countries/regions, and the most cited papers, most popular papers, as well as the most frequent topics and their trends are identified and analyzed. Social network methods are employed for revealing collaboration patterns among contributors through author- and institution-level coauthorship. The results show that China is playing a critical role in ITS research during this period but the interinstitution collaborations are less prevalent than it used to be. Overall data have indicated that IEEE TITS has made tremendous progress and contributed significantly to the accelerated growth of ITS fields over the last three years.

AB Statement of problem. Intraoral scan body (ISB) design is highly variable and its role in the digital workflow and accuracy of digital scans is not well understood.
   Purpose. The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the relevant reports pertaining to ISBs with regard to design and accuracy and to describe their evolution and role in the digital dentistry workflow. Special attention was placed on their key features in relation to intraoral scanning technology and the digitization process.
   Materials and methods. A MEDLINE/PubMed search was performed to identify relevant reports pertaining to ISB usage in dentistry. This search included but was not limited to scan body features and design, scan body accuracy, and scan body techniques and the role of ISBs in computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) processes. Commercially available scan bodies were examined, and a patient situation was shown highlighting the use of ISBs in the digital workflow.
   Results. Deficiencies in the reports were found regarding various scan body topics, including ISB features/design, accuracy, and the role of ISBs in CAD-CAM processes.
   Conclusions. ISBs are complex implant-positioning-transfer devices that play an essential role in the digital workflow and fabrication of accurately fitting implant-supported restorations. With scanner technology rapidly evolving and becoming more widespread, future studies are needed and should be directed toward all parts of the digital workflow when using ISBs. By understanding the basic components of ISBs and how they relate to digital scanning and CAD CAM technology, more emphasis may be placed on their importance and usage in the digital workflow to ensure accurate transfer of implant position to the virtual and analog definitive cast. Efforts should be made by clinicians to identify an optimal ISB design in relation to the specific intraoral scanning technology being used.

AB Research has indicated the importance of representational competence for learning science. Issues related to the nature of students' representational competence, such as how they demonstrate representational competence across different domains of science, require investigation. In the present study, four aspects of representational competence across two domains of science were investigated: use of dynamic representations, use of multiple representations, use of adequate science concepts, and use of visualization strategies. Two instruments, the representational competence of states of matter and the representational competence of carbon cycling assessments were delivered via a computer-based drawing tool and were used to measure 40 senior high school students' representational competence for the topic of states of matter and carbon cycling. The results indicated that the representational competence demonstrated in one topic was not significantly correlated to that demonstrated in the other. The results of path analyses using multiple regressions indicated a trend that the extent to which multiple representations were employed was significantly and closely related to the extent to which appropriate science concepts were applied to make the drawings. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB Background: There is a lack of evidence to support acyclovir administration in pityriasis rosea. Objective: To determine the efficacy of acyclovir in patients with typical pityriasis rosea.
   Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental studies was performed in MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE and others, from January 1990 to October 2016 on acyclovir for pityriasis rosea. Random effect model was used to find the pooled Risk Ratio. Outcomes, evaluated between weeks 1 to 8, were regression of lesions, cessation of lesions, decrease of symptoms and duration of disease. Comparisons were acyclovir vs. placebo; acyclovir vs. symptomatic treatment; acyclovir vs. antibiotic; acyclovir vs. observation and combined therapy (acyclovir plus symptomatic treatment) vs. symptomatic treatment alone.
   Results: Seven papers were analyzed with 324 participants, of which 159 received acyclovir and 165 were controls. Acyclovir was superior to placebo for complete regression of lesions at week 1 (Risk Ratio 5.72, CI95% 2.36-13.88). However, combined therapy was not superior to symptomatic treatment at week 4 (Risk Ratio 1.46, CI95% 0.93-2.29). Individual studies showed the superiority of acyclovir for the control of symptoms and pruritus. Study limitations: We faced differences designs of trials and inconsistency between reports.
   Conclusion: Symptomatic treatment is a reasonable option for pityriasis rosea, and the addition of acyclovir is justified for the control of symptoms and pruritus.

AB Written patient education materials are essential to motivate and help patients to participate in their own care, but the production and management of a large collection of high-quality and easily accessible patient education documents can be challenging. Ontologies can aid in these tasks, but the existing resources are not directly applicable to patient education. An ontology that models patient education documents and their readers was constructed. The Delphi method was used to identify a compact but sufficient set of entities with which the topics of documents may be described. The preferred terms of the entities were also considered to ensure their understandability. In the ontology, readers may be characterized by gender, age group, language, and role (patient or professional), whereas documents may be characterized by audience, topic(s), and content, as well as the time and place of use. The Delphi method yielded 265 unique document topics that are organized into seven hierarchies. Advantages and disadvantages of the ontology design, as well as possibilities for improvements, were identified. The patient education material ontology can enhance many applications, but further development is needed to reach its full potential.

AB Understanding how ecosystem vulnerability in response to climate change is generated and distributed is an important topic; however, quantitative assessments of the vulnerability process remain relatively rare. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) regards ecosystem vulnerability as sensitivity or susceptibility to harm, lacking the capacity to cope and adapt. Through analysis of the concept of vulnerability, we propose a response-based quantitative method to assess ecosystem vulnerability, integrating the concepts of sensitivity and adaptability. This method was applied to assess ecosystem vulnerability in China from 1981 to 2050. The results indicated that vulnerability would develop in nearly 30% of the terrestrial ecosystems of China. Vulnerability would be severe in the grassland and desert ecosystems, distributed mainly in the Tianshan Mountain and the Inner Mongolia Plateau. As the effects of sensitivity and adaptability to temperature and precipitation differ, obvious regional differences exist between the ecosystem vulnerability zones in China. For example, the effects of climate warming would be severe in the northwest of the Loess Plateau, with the vulnerability caused mainly by high sensitivity to warming. However, the vulnerability in the southeastern part would be caused mainly by low adaptability to increasing precipitation. Compared with previous research, our method emphasizes the critical role of adaptability, which enhances the scientificity and reasonableness of assessing ecosystem vulnerability, and enriches the methodology adopted under the IPCC framework. However, as we did not consider fully the autonomous adaptation mechanism in ecosystem vulnerability, this aspect should be combined with other factors in future study.

AB Background: While palliative care (PC) competencies for medical school graduates have been defined, the lack of established curriculum models and assessment tools hampers curricular evaluation.
   Objective: To describe the scope and content of the University of Rochester's longitudinal, integrated four-year PC curriculum after 17 years of implementation, review student evaluative responses, and compare the curriculum to national competency standards.
   Design and Setting: Combining and reorganizing a published PC curriculum assessment tool and a list of medical school PC competencies, we created a novel nine-topic framework to assess the content coverage of our curriculum. We queried our electronic medical school curriculum database and surveyed course and clerkship directors, as well as PC, pain, ethics, and humanities faculty, to locate where and when PC topics are taught and to collate student responses to these experiences.
   Results: We present a comprehensive list of PC curricular activities over a four-year medical school experience. The curriculum covers all nine PC topics longitudinally in multiple formats. Five in-depth activities cover multiple PC topics in a format that integrates biological, psychological, and social dimensions; these activities have survived and evolved over 17 years in our setting. A majority of year 3 University of Rochester students feel "well" or "extremely well" trained in PC.
   Conclusions: Our four-year PC curriculum provides robust and developmentally appropriate training that addresses all nine evidence-based core topics for PC education. Medical student feedback and their Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) survey responses suggest that they find their PC learning experiences rewarding. This curriculum could serve as a model for other schools.

AB The topic of social impact assessment (SIA) is growing in importance, and this is especially true for social enterprises. The mission of solving social problems is the main feature of these organizations; thus, the need to assess the extent to which this mission is fulfilled becomes essential. The purpose of this paper is to propose a conceptual model that could explain the attitude-behavior gap in SIA practice through the development of a coherence/displacement matrix, to gauge if social entrepreneurs are coherent in walking their talks. The study is based on a mixed-methods approach focused on the Italian context. An empirical quantitative analysis has been performed to identify the misalignment between attitude and behavior. The gaps that emerged are then analyzed through in-depth interviews with social entrepreneurs, to provide a pilot case study that could test the model and gain further insights into how those gaps could be filled.

AB The continuously expanding urban-rural income gap is an indisputable fact during the rapid economic development in China. Accordingly, narrowing the urban-rural income gap is an important topic and considerable concern in the academic circles and practical field. To explore the causes of the urban-rural income gap, the influential effects of social security expenditure, demographic structural changes, and urban-rural income gap were analyzed using the fixed effect model of the cluster-robust standard errors and the provincial data of 341 samples which covered 31 provincial areas in Mainland China from 2006 to 2016. Results demonstrate that the growth of social security expenditure narrows the urban-rural income gap, and such effect has evident regional differences. The growth of social security expenditure in Western China further expands the urban-rural income gap owing to the urban bias of fiscal expenditure. In addition, the population aging expands the urban-rural income gap. The urbanization level has significantly negative effect in regulating the relationship between demographic structure and urban-rural income gap. In regions with low urbanization level, the population aging decreases the total social demands and increases the unemployment rate in rural areas, thereby further expanding the urban-rural income gap. The urban bias of social security expenditure further intensifies the urban-rural income gap. On the contrary, regions with high urbanization level have weak dual economic structure that weakens the positive impact of population aging on the urban-rural income gap. The obtained conclusions provide decision-making references for formulating social security and population intervention policy.

AB Economic production and on-time ordering are among the most important topics related to production and inventory control issues. An economical production needs a comprehensive and precise planning to be implemented in all production stages. To have a controlled and comprehensive planning system, economic order quantity (EOQ) or economic production quantity (EPQ) models are usually used in various production-inventory environments to minimize costs, avoid delays in orders, and achieve high performance. To meet the demands, sometimes a multiperiod production-inventory planning that involves several products requires outsourcing. In this paper, a production-procurement plan that integrates EOQ with EPQ is proposed for a multiperiod multi-product production-inventory system with a limited warehouse capacity. The design aims to determine the optimal values of decision variables including the production quantity, the order quantity, inventory, shortages, and machine assignments to produce the products in a planning horizon. The problem is formulated as a non-linear mixed-integer programming model. As the problem becomes NP-Hard, a genetic algorithm (GA) is utilized to find a near-optimal solution. In addition, a random search (RS) algorithm is applied to validate the results obtained and to justify the efficiency of the GA. Since there is no benchmark available in the literature, some randomly generated numerical examples are solved and a sensitivity analysis is performed in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology and the solution algorithm.

AB With the emergence of the big data age, methods for quickly and accurately obtaining valuable hot topics from the vast amount of digitized textual material have attracted much attention. In this work, we focus on topic detection in microblogs in the big data environment. Different from existing approaches, we solve this problem in a distributed way. Specifically, we propose a non-iterative algorithm called parallel two-phase mic-mac hot topic detection (TMHTD), and implement it in the Apache Spark environment. The proposed TMHTD method includes two phases, i.e., the micro-clustering phase and the macro-clustering phase. To improve the accuracy of hot topic detection, three optimization methods, along with TMHTD, are proposed. To handle large databases, we deliberately design a group of MapReduce jobs to concretely accomplish hot topic detection in a highly scalable way. We compare the TMHTD algorithm with the general single-pass algorithm and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. Our experiments are carried out on real-life data sets gathered from the Sina Weibo API. Extensive experimental results indicate that the accuracy and performance of the TMHTD algorithm are significant improvements over previous methods. More specifically, the F-measure value of the TMHTD algorithm shows a 6% and 8% improvement over the general single-pass algorithm and the LDA algorithm, respectively. The run time of the TMHTD algorithm is 7 times and twice as superior to the general single-pass algorithm and the LDA algorithm, respectively. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Motivation: The prediction of off-target mutations in CRISPR-Cas9 is a hot topic due to its relevance to gene editing research. Existing prediction methods have been developed; however, most of them just calculated scores based on mismatches to the guide sequence in CRISPR-Cas9. Therefore, the existing prediction methods are unable to scale and improve their performance with the rapid expansion of experimental data in CRISPR-Cas9. Moreover, the existing methods still cannot satisfy enough precision in off-target predictions for gene editing at the clinical level.
   Results: To address it, we design and implement two algorithms using deep neural networks to predict off-target mutations in CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing (i.e. deep convolutional neural network and deep feedforward neural network). The models were trained and tested on the recently released off-target dataset, CRISPOR dataset, for performance benchmark. Another off-target dataset identified by GUIDE-seq was adopted for additional evaluation. We demonstrate that convolutional neural network achieves the best performance on CRISPOR dataset, yielding an average classification area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 97.2% under stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Interestingly, the deep feedforward neural network can also be competitive at the average AUC of 97.0% under the same setting. We compare the two deep neural network models with the state-of-the-art off-target prediction methods (i.e. CFD, MIT, CROP-IT, and CCTop) and three traditional machine learning models (i.e. random forest, gradient boosting trees, and logistic regression) on both datasets in terms of AUC values, demonstrating the competitive edges of the proposed algorithms. Additional analyses are conducted to investigate the underlying reasons from different perspectives.

AB Based on his own experience in a number of companies, Lee (2004) posits that the Triple-A (agility, adaptability and alignment) is essential for supply chain (SC) management to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage (CA). However, there is a lack of empirical research that analyzes the Triple-A SC and its impacts on CA. The objective of the present work is to address this omission and to provide empirical evidence on this topic using a multiple-informant, international sample from eight developed countries. A consistent partial least squares structural equation model (PLSc) is used on data for 151 manufacturing plants in three industrial sectors to determine whether agility, alignment and adaptability have individual and/or joint effects on achieving a CA in SCs. In relation to the individual effects, different CAs are achieved by each of the Triple-A variables. SC adaptability has been shown to have a significant positive relationship with all the dimensions of CA. SC alignment affects most of these dimensions, but SC agility only affects financial CA and flexibility CA. This research does, however, confirm the positive relationship for the joint effect of the Triple-A SC variables and CA. The effects are significant on all the CA measures except quality. Important implications can be drawn for managers by showing how SC levers can be set to improve performance indicators.

AB Introduction: The aims of the current pilot study were to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the Talking with Teens about Traffic Safety Program. The program consists of a clinic-based health coaching session with parents of adolescents at their annual well-child visit to promote parent-teen communication about teen driver safety including: a Parent Handbook that is designed to serve as a primer on teen driver safety and facilitate parent-teen communication on a variety of teen driver topics; an interactive practice driving toolset; and an endorsement of the materials by the primary care provider. Method: Fifty-four parent-teen dyads (n = 108 total) were recruited from a primary care practice. Dyads were randomized (1:1) into a treatment group or a usual care group. Implementation fidelity was assessed using checklists completed by health coaches and parent interviews. After 6 months, parents reported how often they talked with their teen about 12 safe driving topics (e.g., state graduated driver licensing laws). Results: Parents in the treatment group reported more frequent discussions than parents in the control group on 7 out of the 12 topics. Fidelity data indicate that 100% of sessions were implemented as designed and were acceptable to parents. Conclusions: The program was feasible to administer and there was evidence for preliminary efficacy. Generally, effects were larger for more infrequently discussed topics, which is to be expected due to the potential for ceiling effects on more commonly discussed topics (e.g., distracted driving). A larger multi-site study is warranted. Practical applications: The results from this pilot study provide support for implementation fidelity and establish a proof-of-concept for the Talking with Teens about Traffic Safety Program. The results provide guidance for developing partnerships with pediatricians and parents to develop parent-teen communication interventions on injury prevention topics.

AB Introduction: Benefits of 3D printing techniques, biomodeling and surgical guides are well known in surgery, especially when the same surgeon who performed the surgery participated in the virtual surgical planning. Our objective was to evaluate the transfer of know how of a neutral 3D surgical modeling free open-source software protocol to surgeons with different surgical specialities.
   Methods: A one-day training session was organised in 3D surgical modeling applied to one mandibular reconstruction case with fibula free flap and creation of its surgical guides. Surgeon satisfaction was analysed before and after the training.
   Results: Of 22 surgeons, 59% assessed the training as excellent or very good and 68% considered changing their daily surgical routine and would try to apply our open-source software protocol in their department after a single training day. The mean capacity in using the software improved from 4.13 on 10 before to 6.59 on 10 after training for OsiriX (R) software, from 1.14 before to 5.05 after training for Meshlab (R), from 0.45 before to 4.91 after training for Netfabb1 and from 1.05 before and 4.41 after training for Blender (R). According to surgeons, using the software Blender (R) became harder as the day went on.
   Discussion: Despite improvement in the capacity in using software for all participants, more than a single training day is needed for the transfer of know how on 3D modeling with open-source software. Although the know-how transfer, overall satisfaction, actual learning outcomes and relevance of this training were appropriated, a longer training including different topics will be needed to improve training quality.

TI A new, expanded approach to pediatric cardiology fellowship orientation
SO PROGRESS IN PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID BOOT CAMP; TRAINING-PROGRAM
AB Background: Because of limited and varying resident exposure to pediatric cardiology, rapidly acquiring the necessary knowledge, clinical and technical skills can be overwhelming for incoming pediatric cardiology fellows. To address this, we developed a pediatric cardiology fellowship orientation at the beginning of fellowship using an extended orientation model.
   Methods: We designed and implemented a three-week extended orientation for all rising first year pediatric cardiology fellows at our institution to take place the first month of their training. The extended orientation consisted of: 1) daily lunchtime didactic sessions focused on general pediatric cardiology topics; 2) hands-on echocardiography experience (total 4.5 days) and high fidelity simulations focused on cardiac emergencies, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and cardiac palliative care; and 3) day-long precepted experiences in core clinical rotations. Pre-and post-extended orientation knowledge self-assessment results were compared using paired t-tests.
   Results: Due to protection from clinical duties during the three-week extended orientation period, all seven first-year pediatric cardiology fellows were able to participate in 100% of these sessions. After the extended orientation, participants demonstrated significant improvement in self-assessed knowledge in all clinical areas, with mean scores increasing from 45 +/- 15% pre- to 74 +/- 11% post-orientation (p <= 0.001). The greatest improvements occurred in echocardiography, catheterization, and cardiac anatomy. Based on a post-orientation feedback, additional education dedicated to electrophysiology, including EKG interpretation, arrhythmia management, and pacemaker basics, was recommended.
   Conclusion: A three-week extended orientation model for pediatric cardiology fellowship orientation at the beginning of fellowship effectively introduces incoming fellows to key clinical topics unique to cardiology. In the current educational era, this represents an alternative approach to the traditional orientation model. Facilitating full participation in these sessions without competing clinical duties may enable all fellows to start their training with the necessary clinical foundation and may improve their preparedness for clinical responsibilities.

AB Background: Child care settings provide opportunities for obesity prevention by implementing nutrition/physical activity best practices. This study examines how center policies, provider training, family education, and center demographics relate to best practices for nutrition/physical activity in Maryland's child care centers.
   Methods: A survey, including minor modifications to The Nutrition and Physical Activity Self-Assessment for Child Care (Go NAP SACC), was sent by e-mail to center directors statewide. Best practice sum scores (dependent variable) were calculated, including physical activity (17 items), feeding environment (18 items), and food served (19 items). Adjusted regression models analyzed the number of nutrition/physical activity policies, provider training topics, and family education opportunities related to best practice scores.
   Results: Response rate was 40% (n=610/1506) with 69% independent centers (vs. organization sponsored), 19% with Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP enrolled), and 50.2% centers with majority (>= 70%) Caucasian children and 16.8% centers with majority African American children. Centers reported 40.8% of physical activity best practices, 52.0% of feeding environment best practices, and 51.6% of food served best practices. Centers reported (mean) 7.9 of 16 nutrition/physical activity-relevant policies, 6.9 of 13 provider training topics, and 4.4 of 8 family education opportunities. Regression models yielded associations with best practices: policies and provider training with feeding environment (B=0.26, p<0.001; B=0.26, p=0.001, respectively); policies with foods served (B=0.22, p=0.002); and policies, provider training, and feeding environment with physical activity (B=0.19, p=0.001; B=0.24, p=0.010; B=0.38, p<0.001).
   Conclusions: Nutrition/physical activity best practices in child care are supported by specific policies, provider training, and family education activities.

AB Introduction. Procrastination is a very interesting topic because even if procrastinators could anticipate the negative consequences, they still intentionally do necessary tasks with delay. This may be because some procrastinators receive positive outcomes referred to active procrastinator, but some are not called passive procrastinator. Verifying the motivational belief moderates these two different types of procrastination; therefore, this study evaluates consistency of two different configurations. Model 1 is based on achievement goal theory integrated factors between academic self-efficacy and achievement goal (achievement goals -> academic self-efficacy -> academic achievement). Model 3 is based on social cognitive theory of motivation separated factors between achievement goal and academic self-efficacy (academic self-efficacy, achievement goals -> academic achievement) across the three groups of procrastinators (non-procrastinators, active-procrastinators, and passive procrastinators). Moreover, this study investigated the different patterns of structural relations (including both direct and indirect relationship) between the achievement goals, academic self-efficacy and academic achievement.
   Method. The sample consisted of 988 Thai undergraduate students with an average age of 20 (SD = 0.99) ranging from 18 to 27 years. Structure equation model was employed to test the path model and Multi-group path analyses were used to verify differences in the path coefficients across the three types of procrastinators.
   Results. The finding confirmed that with Model 1there were a higher number of significant relationships that integrated achievement goals and academic self-efficacy pertaining to academic achievement than with the Model 3 which separated achievement goal and academic self-efficacy relative to academic achievement, as well as across the three types of procrastinators.
   Discussion and Conclusion. There was a substantial result of the importance of integration between academic self-efficacy and achievement goals for passive procrastinators showing in Model 1 that academic self-efficacy mediated relationships between achievement goals and academic achievement for the passive procrastinators but not the active-procrastinator or non-procrastinator groups. The implications of the findings across the three groups of procrastination are discussed.

ID ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT; VALUATION; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; POLICY
AB Accounting for ecosystem services in environmental decision making is an emerging research topic. Modern frameworks for ecosystem services assessment emphasize evaluating the social benefits of ecosystems, in terms of who benefits and by how much, to aid in comparing multiple courses of action. Structured methods that use decision analytic-approaches are emerging for the practice of ecological restoration. In this article, we combine ecosystem services assessment with structured decision making to estimate and evaluate measures of the potential benefits of ecological restoration with a case study in the Woonasquatucket River watershed, Rhode Island, USA. We partnered with a local watershed management organization to analyze dozens of candidate wetland restoration sites for their abilities to supply five ecosystem servicesflood water retention, scenic landscapes, learning opportunities, recreational opportunities, and birds. We developed 22 benefit indicators related to the ecosystem services as well as indicators for social equity and reliability that benefits will sustain in the future. We applied conceptual modeling and spatial analysis to estimate indicator values for each candidate restoration site. Lastly, we developed a decision support tool to score and aggregate the values for the organization to screen the restoration sites. Results show that restoration sites in urban areas can provide greater social benefits than sites in less urban areas. Our research approach is general and can be used to investigate other restoration planning studies that perform ecosystem services assessment and fit into a decision-making process.

AB BACKGROUND: Depression is common in asthma and is associated with poor outcomes. However, antidepressant therapy in depressed patients with asthma has been the topic of little research.
   OBJECTIVE: This study examined the impact of antidepressant treatment with escitalopram versus placebo on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (IDS-SR), Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), and oral corticosteroid use in patients with asthma and major depressive disorder (MDD).
   METHODS: Single-site 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial of escitalopram (10 mg/d) was conducted in 139 outpatients with asthma and MDD. Randomization was stratified by oral corticosteroid use (>= 3 bursts in past 12 months, yes or no) and baseline depressive symptom severity (HRSD score >= 20) (higher severity, n = 42) versus less than 3 bursts, HRSD score less than 20, or both (lower severity, n = 97). The primary data analysis was conducted using hierarchical linear modeling Version 7.01 on the higher and lower severity samples and post hoc was conducted on the combined sample.
   RESULTS: Among the higher severity completers (n = 21), a significant reduction in the ACQ score (P = .04) and oral corticosteroid use (P = .04) was observed with escitalopram. In the combined sample, no significant differences were observed, but a trend toward greater reduction in the IDS-SR score was observed with escitalopram (P = .07). Side effects were comparable across groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that patients with more severe asthma and depression symptomatology may have a positive response, in terms of both asthma and depressive symptom reduction, to antidepressant treatment. (C) 2018 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

ID AUTOIGNITION; MODEL
AB The design and development of high efficiency spark-ignition engines continues to be limited by the consideration of knock. Although the topic of spark knock has been the subject of comprehensive research since the early 1900s, little has been reported on the coupling of the engine thermodynamics and knock. This work uses an engine cycle simulation together with a submodel for the knock phenomena to explore these connections. First, the autoignition characteristics as represented by a recent (2014) Arrhenius expression for the reaction time of the end gases are examined for a range of temperatures and pressures. In spite of the exponential dependence on temperature, pressure appears to dominate the ignition time for the conditions examined. Higher pressures (and higher temperatures) tend to enhance the potential for knock. Second, knock is determined as function of engine design and operating parameters. The trends are consistent with expectations, and the results provide a systematic presentation of knock occurrence. Engine parameters explored include compression ratio, engine speed, inlet pressure, start of combustion, heat transfer, and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Changes of cylinder pressures and temperatures of the unburned zone as engine parameters were varied are shown to be directly responsible for the changes of the knock characteristics.

AB Ayurveda is a traditional Indian system of medicine that is more than 3000 years old, consisting mostly of aspecific diet, oily infusions mainly in the area of the head, enemas, medicinal plants and yoga. It is based on anaturopathic and anthropological belief in association with the hinduistic religion. Ayurveda has been practiced very successfully in India but so far it has only been insufficiently appreciated by western medicine, especially psychiatry. An exception is Scharfetter from Zurich who wrote a review article on this topic in 1976. Nevertheless, it is probable that particularly the immunological mechanisms of psychotic and affective disorders can be influenced by the application of ayurvedic methods; however, the empirical data source, particularly with respect to randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses regarding psychiatric disorder symptoms is limited. Even if Ayurveda is applied in a highly individualized manner, this should be rapidly improved for further evidential assessment. First positive experiences in the neuropsychiatric field in Germany are already available.

AB This article concerns the experimental evaluation of changes in the stress state in overconsolidated clay for two geotechnical applications: pile installation and slope stability. The first topic focuses on the experimental evaluation of change in the stress state that is due to pile installation, especially on the measurements before and after pile installation. The procedure was carried out for the evaluation of the effect of the installation of auger cast in place piles in overconsolidated clay. The results show the problem of predicting the shaft capacity in a new light. They contradict simplified prediction models for evaluating the influenced zone and the magnitude of the soil stress changes. For the second topic, it is described how the dilatometer test (DMT) can be used to evaluate the stability of slopes, to determine the risk of instability, and how the cause of the failure can be directly related to the DMT measurement. The description involves discussing the results of tests before the period of instability, during the period of instability, and after stabilization, using the K-D value (K-D = horizontal stress index) as a representative value to assess the risk of instability.

ID SCHEME
AB As a typical example of cyber-physical systems, intelligent vehicles are receiving increasing attention, and the obstacle avoidance problem for such vehicles has become a hot topic of discussion. This paper presents a simultaneous trajectory planning and tracking controller for use under cruise conditions based on a model predictive control (MPC) approach to address obstacle avoidance for an intelligent vehicle. The reference trajectory is parameterized as a cubic function in time and is determined by the lateral position and velocity of the intelligent vehicle and the velocity and yaw angle of the obstacle vehicle at the start point of the lane change maneuver. Then, the control sequence for the vehicle is incorporated into the expression for the reference trajectory that is used in the MPC optimization problem by treating the lateral velocity of the intelligent vehicle at the end point of the lane change as an intermediate variable. In this way, trajectory planning and tracking are both captured in a single MPC optimization problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed simultaneous trajectory planning and tracking approach, joint veDYNA-Simulink simulations were conducted in the unconstrained and constrained cases under leftward and rightward lane change conditions. The results illustrate that the proposed MPC-based simultaneous trajectory planning and tracking approach achieves acceptable obstacle avoidance performance for an intelligent vehicle.

AB ObjectiveWhile some individual studies have suggested an association between periodontal disease and breast cancer, there has not been a formal meta-analysis that collates the existing evidence supporting the hypothesis that periodontal disease leads to a higher risk of developing breast cancer. Accordingly, this meta-analysis was conducted.
   MethodsRelevant studies published until April 2018 were retrieved and were screened according to established inclusion criteria. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the association between periodontal disease and the risk of breast cancer and fixed effect models were used according to the results of the heterogeneity test.
   ResultsEight studies, involving 168,111 individuals, were identified as having explored the association between periodontal disease and breast cancer. Summary estimates in view of adjusted data showed that periodontal disease did increase susceptibility to breast cancer (RR=1.18, 95%CI: 1.11-1.26, I-2=17.6%), with robust results confirmed by sensitivity analysis.
   ConclusionOur results provided evidence of a modest positive association between periodontal disease and breast cancer. Implementation of practical measures to prevent and treat periodontal disease is of great public health significance. Moreover, additional studies are recommended to explore this topic in more detail.

AB It is well known that accurate forecasts of mortality rates are essential to various demographic research topics, such as population projections and the pricing of insurance products such as pensions and annuities. In this study, we argue that including the lagged rates of neighbouring ages cannot further improve mortality forecasting after allowing for autocorrelations. This is because the sample cross-correlation function cannot exhibit meaningful and statistically significant correlations. In other words, rates of neighbouring ages are usually not leading indicators in mortality forecasting. Therefore, multivariate stochastic mortality models like the classic Lee-Carter may not necessarily lead to more accurate forecasts, compared with sophisticated univariate models. Using Australian mortality data, simulation and empirical studies employing the Lee-Carter, Functional Data, Vector Autoregression, Autoregression-Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity and exponential smoothing (ETS) state space models are performed. Results suggest that ETS models consistently outperform the others in terms of forecasting accuracy. This conclusion holds for both female and male mortality data with different empirical features across various forecasting error measurements. Hence, ETS can be a widely useful tool to model and forecast mortality rates in actuarial practice.

AB Background: With global changes in the current state of work and employment, the role of health-adverse psychosocial work environments has received increasing attention in developed as well as in rapidly developing countries. Thus, there is a need to apply valid measurement tools for monitoring and preventive purposes. This study aims to examine the factorial structure and psychometric properties of the Persian version of the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) questionnaire, assessing one of the internationally leading concepts of stressful work.
   Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study of a random sample of 202 white collar employees in an industrial company in Iran analyzes the ERI scales by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Moreover, aspects of construct and criterion validity are tested. To this end, correlations of ERI scales with subscales of organizational injustice, a complementary work stress model, and also the correlations of ERI scales with a questionnaire assessing psychosomatic symptoms are performed.
   Results: Internal consistency of the three ERI scales was satisfactory (Cronbach alpha effort: 0.76, reward: 0.79, overcommitment: 0.75). Fit indices of confirmatory factor analysis pointed to an adequate representation of the theoretical construct (e.g., adjusted goodness of fit index (AGFI): 0.73, goodness of fit index (GFI): 0.78). Negative correlations with subscales of organizational injustice supported the notion of construct validity of the ERI scales, and positive correlations of ERI scales with psychosomatic symptoms indicated preliminary criterion validity.
   Conclusion: The Persian version of the ERI questionnaire has acceptable psychometric properties and can be used as a valid instrument in research on this topic. (C) 2017 Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.

AB Resilience is a major research focus covering a wide range of topics from biodiversity conservation to ecosystem (service) management. Model simulations can assess the resilience of, for example, plant species, measured as the return time to conditions prior to a disturbance. This requires process-based models (PBM) that implement relevant processes such as regeneration and reproduction and thus successfully reproduce transient dynamics after disturbances. Such models are often complex and thus limited to either short-term or small-scale applications, whereas many research questions require species predictions across larger spatial and temporal scales. We suggest a framework to couple a PBM and a statistical species distribution model (SDM), which transfers the results of a resilience analysis by the PBM to SDM predictions. The resulting hybrid model combines the advantages of both approaches: the convenient applicability of SDMs and the relevant process detail of PBMs in abrupt environmental change situations. First, we simulate dynamic responses of species communities to a disturbance event with a PBM. We aggregate the response behavior in two resilience metrics: return time and amplitude of the response peak. These metrics are then used to complement long-term SDM projections with dynamic short-term responses to disturbance. To illustrate our framework, we investigate the effect of abrupt short-term groundwater level and salinity changes on coastal vegetation at the German Baltic Sea. We found two example species to be largely resilient, and, consequently, modifications of SDM predictions consisted mostly of smoothing out peaks in the occurrence probability that were not confirmed by the PBM. Discrepancies between SDM- and PBM-predicted species responses were caused by community dynamics simulated in the PBM and absent from the SDM. Although demonstrated with boosted regression trees (SDM) and an existing individual-based model, IBC-grass (PBM), our flexible framework can easily be applied to other PBM and SDM types, as well as other definitions of short-term disturbances or long-term trends of environmental change. Thus, our framework allows accounting for biological feedbacks in the response to short- and long-term environmental changes as a major advancement in predictive vegetation modeling.

AB The Vlora Bay is a roughly north-west-south-east-oriented tectonic depression located at the collision zone between the Apulian Foreland and the Albano-Hellenic Chain in south-western Albania. The bay exhibits a triangular-shaped geometry, which is the result of different tectonic phases that occurred mostly between the end of the Neogene and the Quaternary. The bay consists of two distinct physiographic sections: a shallow water marine offshore area and a recently emerged onshore sector. Along the onshore sector, Pleistocene clastic sediments filling the Pleistocene Vlora Basin crop out due to the recent uplift phases. The sedimentological and stratigraphic organization of the Vlora Basin deposits and the role played by Quaternary tectonic structures in their deposition are the main topics of this paper. A detailed field survey, supported by a geoelectrical survey, reveals a series of unconformity-bounded stratigraphic units deposited in two north-west-south-east-oriented subbasins. The two subbasins are separated by an intrabasinal, fault-bounded, pre-Quaternary morpho-structural high and are mainly filled by shallow marine to continental deposits. A detailed structural analysis shows different tectonic phases affecting the area during the Pleistocene. Additionally, the geophysical survey facilitates the reconstruction of the deep structure of the basin and provides a better definition of the basin margins. Based on both geological and geophysical data, a tectonostratigraphic evolutionary model is proposed for the Vlora Basin Pleistocene sedimentary infill. This model consists of three phases of sedimentation that were essentially controlled by fault activity and by the progressive uplift of the area.

   Taylor; welfare state
AB British idealism has led an ambiguous existence in any overview of British historical and political thought in the twentieth century. Seen partly as an alien Continental intrusion into presumably typical British priorities of empiricism, positivism, and utilitarianism, it was badly damaged by its putative associations with the military enemy of two world wars. Admir Skodo's meticulous study of British idealist revisionists during the postwar period 1945-1980 repairs this damage by showing the extended influence of that idealism as funneled through the new idealism of the interwar period represented mainly by the philosophers R. G. Collingwood and Michael Oakeshott. Skodo demonstrates how these idealist revisionists deeply influenced postwar British historiography by underscoring qualities of humanism, pluralism, and variety not characteristically associated with idealism, reinterpreted a range of important topics in British history from the Tudors through the English civil wars to the Victorian period, and came up with political theorizing that celebrated the postwar welfare state while indicating its vulnerabilities to an increasingly technologized society. Just as Skodo's protagonists negotiated the 1970s transition in Britain's turn to Europe, so his account proves stimulating for contemporary concerns regarding a post-Brexit Britain. The final part of the essay therefore looks at some suggested models, such as the Anglosphere or a Singapore in the Atlantic for Britain, before concluding with reflections on the importance according to a Hegelian reading of the modern rational state of the continued influence of Oxbridge intellectuals on the evolution of British directions and goals since the Victorian age.

Other considerations include the effects of cyanide, carbon monoxide, and fire suppressants. This Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) will provide the reader with a brief overview of these important topics and general management strategies for each as well as for inhalation injury. Chlorine, phosgene, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia are either of intermediate or high water solubility leading to immediate reactions with mucous membranes of the face, throat, and lungs and rapid symptoms onset after exposure. The exception to rapid symptom onset is phosgene which may take up to a day to develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Management of these patients includes early airway management, lung-protective ventilator strategies, aggressive pulmonary toilet, and avoidance of volume overload.

AB We develop in this paper a comprehensive linear mathematical framework to study the benefit of real-time information and the impact of resulting user adaptive route choice behaviours on network performance. The framework formulates the information-based stochastic user equilibrium (ISUE) dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) problem for a multiple origin-destination (OD) network. Using the framework, we prove the linkage between the user equilibrium (UE) and system optimal (SO) solutions underpinned by the first-in-first out (FIFO) principle. This important property then enables us to develop an incremental loading method to obtain the ISUE solutions efficiently by solving a sequence of linear programs. Moreover, the proposed method is more scalable that avoids a huge enumeration of paths in large-scale networks as done in path-based methods of the existing literature on this topic. We show via numerical examples the impact of information on both route choices and network performance, and demonstrate the significant improvements in the obtained ISUE solution both in terms of accuracy and computational complexity.

AB An assessment of attitudes toward language awareness in physical education classes offers the possibility to evaluate learning and teaching opportunities related to this topic offered at universities. However, valid research instruments for this undertaking are currently lacking. The present article reports on the development and validation of a questionnaire for assessing attitudes toward language awareness in sports classes ("Erfassung von Einstellungen zur Sprachbildung im Sportunterricht," ESBiS). A validation study of the ESBiS included NaEuro>= 254 student physical education teachers, 37.8% female, mean age 22.16 years, standard deviation 2.74 years. Explorative factor analysis identified a five-factor structure with the ESBiS factors linguistic goal and performance transparency, promotion of writing, language-corrective feedback, use of scaffolding, and advancement of technical vocabulary. The analyses indicate good factorial validity and reliability of the individual scales. The ESBiS factors can be satisfactorily modelled using confirmatory factor analyses. The ESBiS instrument thus demonstrates good psychometric quality. Furthermore, in some instances, very low positive correlations of the ESBiS factors with the validation criterion of multicultural attitudes could be shown. Additionally, correlation analyses with individual characteristics of the student physical education teachers showed that the developed instrument has sensitivity and discriminatory ability.

AB As the quantity and complexity of network threats grow, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have become critical for securing networks. Achieving computer network intrusion detection with these IDSs requires high-level information technology and security expertise because malicious traffic has to be rigorously analyzed and the appropriate IDS rules written to effectively detect vulnerabilities that may potentially be exploited. However, incorrect IDS rules may produce numerous false positives, thereby degrading the performance of the IDS, and even worse, paralyzing the network. In this paper, we present a novel approach that exploits the Latent Dirichle Allocation (LDA) algorithm to generate IDS rules. Our proposed method, called LDA-based Automatic Rule Generation (LaaGen), automatically performs an analysis of the malicious traffic and extracts the appropriate attack signatures that will be used for IDS rules. LARGen first extracts multiple signature strings embedded in network flows. Then, the flows are classified based on the extracted signature strings, and key content strings for malicious traffic are identified through the LDA inferential topic model. Those key content strings are the core of an IDS rule that can detect malicious traffic. We study the effectiveness of LDA in the context of network attack signature generation via extensive experiments with real network trace data, consisting of both benign and malicious traffic. Experimental results confirm that threat rules generated from LARGen accurately detect every cyber attack with high accuracy.

ID ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; OPTIMIZATION; EFFICIENCY
AB Nowadays, the accurate calculation and evaluation of processing carbon emissions (which refer to the total carbon emissions emitted by CNC consuming electrical energy during machining process) have become a hot topic owning to their great role on optimizing cutting processes, and thus reducing the global carbon dioxide emissions. However, the existing carbon emission calculation models for machining process do not pay much attention to the effect of tool wear on processing carbon emissions, which leads to the inaccurate evaluation. So in this paper, a practical carbon emission model for machining process is carried out. The model consists of two parts: (1) a relationship between processing carbon emissions and cutting power (which is the power only caused by removing materials from workpiece) and (2) a novel cutting power model considering tool wear condition. Afterwards, orthogonal experiments are performed on three different CNC machine tools in order to fit cutting power model's constants and coefficients. Experiment results and related data analysis indicate that the presented cutting power model and the experimental evaluation method are accurate, and the flank wear length (VB), which is the index of evaluating tool wear condition, is necessary to be introduced as an independent variable. Compared with other models which do not consider the tool wear condition, this model succeeds to improve the calculation precision of processing carbon emissions, and provides more accurate data supporting the cutting parameter optimization.

AB Purpose: Speech rate convergence has been reported previously as a phenomenon in which one's speech rate is influenced by his/her partner's speech rate. This phenomenon has been demonstrated in artificial settings, and to some extent, in mother-child interactions. The purpose of this study was to explore speech rate adjustment in a quasi-natural adult-adult conversation.
   Methods: An A-B-A-B paradigm was used, in which ten adults conversed on a given topic with two experimenters. Speech rates of both communication partners were measured.
   Results: Participants significantly reduced their speech rate, in response to the experimenters' reduction in speech rate. However, the participants' reduction in speech rate was significantly smaller than the experimenters' reduction in speech rate. In addition, during the controlled slow speech rate, the participants' speech rate correlated negatively with that of the experimenters'.
   Conclusion: Results suggest that speech rate convergence is a non-linear phenomenon, and may be affected by various linguistic as well as communicational factors. From a clinical perspective, the results support the use of the modeling strategy in speech therapy, as a means to facilitate a reduction in clients' speech rate.

AB The study of network reliability started in 1956 with a groundbreaking paper by E.F. Moore and C.E. Shannon. They introduced a probabilistic model of network reliability, where the nodes of the network were considered to be perfectly reliable, and the links or edges could fail independently with a certain probability. The problem is to determine the probability that the network remains connected under these conditions. If all the edges have the same probability of failing, this leads to the so-called reliability polynomial of the network. Sixty years later, a lot of research has accumulated on this topic, and many variants of the original problem have been investigated. We review the basic concepts and results, as well as some recent developments in this area, and we outline some important research directions.

AB This study is significant because learning with mobile devices is increasing as a method of educating and training learners with visual impairments, but evaluation of its method is rare. In addition, the epistemological model used in this study is designed to improve future research designs. This article reviews the literature on the use of mobile devices by learners with visual impairments in a variety of learning environments. The study's three objectives are to pursue avenues of research in m-learning and visual impairment, stimulate debate on the nature and role of mobile technologies in the education of learners with visual impairments, and develop a debate on the best use of technologies in m-learning. The study uses an epistemological model of visual impairment as an instrument to critically analyze different ontologies and paradigms of research. The epistemological model is also analyzed as an analytical instrument. The study identifies three academic paradigms in this field: (1) conceptual, (2) design and user testing, (3) m-learning in situ. The study also finds these three paradigms ontologize visual impairment in different ways, meaning that there is little cohesion in research and practice. The study finds that research on the development and use of technologies by learners with visual impairments is restricted by a lack of cohesion in theory and practice. This lack of cohesion is thought to be largely due to the immature nature of this topic as a field of study.

AB AimsTo investigate what dental hygienists' practice characteristics and oral health topics are associated with additional time dental hygienists spent on educating patients with diabetes.
   MethodsA one-page survey was mailed to 2237 registered dental hygienists in South Carolina. Survey questions focused on perceptions of dental hygienists regarding their oral health preventive education for patients with diabetes. After two follow-up mails, we received 995 usable questionnaires.
   ResultsMultivariable logistic regression modeling showed dental hygienist respondents who spent additional time educating patients with diabetes about oral health felt they had adequately covered the topics on effects of periodontal disease related to diabetes, effects of uncontrolled diabetes on periodontal disease, and nutrition and dietary counseling. In addition, a higher number of patients with diabetes treated per week, and a shorter recall interval for patients were also associated with more likelihood of respondents spending additional time educating patients with diabetes.
   ConclusionResults suggest that the additional time that dental hygienist respondents spent on educating patients with diabetes was related to oral health issues associated with diabetes, not just repetition of routine oral hygiene and plaque control instructions.

AB Cloud computing refers to maximizing efficiency by sharing computational and storage resources, while data-parallel systems exploit the resources available in the cloud to perform parallel transformations over large amounts of data. In the same line, considerable emphasis has been recently given to two apparently disjoint research topics: data-parallel, and eventually consistent, distributed systems. Declarative networking has been recently proposed to ease the task of programming in the cloud, by allowing the programmer to express only the desired result and leave the implementation details to the responsibility of the run-time system. In this context, we deem it appropriate to propose a study on a logic-programming-based computational model for eventually consistent, data-parallel systems, the keystone of which is provided by the recent finding that the class of programs that can be computed in an eventually consistent, coordination-free way is that of monotonic programs. This principle is called Consistency and Logical Monotonicity (CALM) and has been proven by Ameloot et al. for distributed, asynchronous settings. We advocate that CALM should be employed as a basic theoretical tool also for data-parallel systems, wherein computation usually proceeds synchronously in rounds and where communication is assumed to be reliable. We deem this problem relevant and interesting, especially for what concerns parallel dataflow optimizations. Nowadays, we are in fact witnessing an increasing concern about understanding which properties distinguish synchronous from asynchronous parallel processing, and when the latter can replace the former. It is general opinion that coordination-freedom can be seen as a major discriminant factor. In this work, we make the case that the current form of CALM does not hold in general for data-parallel systems, and show how, using novel techniques, the satisfiability of the CALM principle can still be obtained although just for the subclass of programs called connected monotonic queries. We complete the study with considerations on the relationships between our model and the one employed by Ameloot et al., showing that our techniques subsume the latter when the synchronization constraints imposed on the system are loosened.

AB Text mining techniques were applied to a corpus consisting in the titles of 2,454 documents on Mudejar art, a style unique to Spanish art history. Probabilistic topic modelling was used to analyse the semantic structure underlying the suite of documents studied. Two classifications were obtained, an initial, generic division into five topics followed by a second more refined division into ten. These were compared to the preliminary subject categories found for the corpus with the guidance of an area specialist. The classifications delivered by the automatic and manual procedures were observed to be compatible. The conclusion drawn was that the deployment of digitized data affords the opportunity to conduct humanities studies from new perspectives.

AB BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial replacement, a form of nuclear transfer, has been proposed as a germline therapy to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases. Mitochondrial replacement therapy has been licensed for clinical application in the UK, and already carried out in other countries, but little is known about negative or unintended effects on the health of offspring born using this technique.
   OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Studies in invertebrate models have used techniques that achieve mitochondrial replacement to create offspring with novel combinations of mitochondrial and nuclear genotype. These have demonstrated that the creation of novel mito-chondrial-nuclear interactions can lead to alterations in offspring characteristics, such as development rates, fertility and longevity. However, it is currently unclear whether such interactions could similarly affect the outcomes of vertebrate biomedical studies, which have sought to assess the efficacy of the replacement therapy.
   SEARCH METHODS: This systematic review addresses whether the effects of mitochondrial replacement on offspring characteristics differ in magnitude between biological (conducted on invertebrate models, with an ecological or evolutionary focus) and biomedical studies (conducted on vertebrate models, with a clinical focus). Studies were selected based on a key-word search in 'Web of Science', complemented by backward searches of reviews on the topic of mitochondrial-nuclear (mito-nuclear) interactions. In total, 43 of the resulting 116 publications identified in the search contained reliable data to estimate effect sizes of mitochondrial replacement. We found no evidence of publication bias when examining effect-size estimates across sample sizes.
   OUTCOMES: Mitochondrial replacement consistently altered the phenotype, with significant effects at several levels of organismal performance and health, including gene expression, anatomy, metabolism and life-history. Biomedical and biological studies, while differing in the methods used to achieve mitochondrial replacement, showed only marginally significant differences in effect-size estimates (-0.233 [CI: -0.495 to -0.011]), with larger effect-size estimates in biomedical studies (0.697 [CI: 0.450-0.956]) than biological studies (0.462 [CI: 0.287-0.688]). Humans showed stronger effects than other species. Effects of mitochondrial replacement were also stronger in species with a higher basal metabolic rate. Based on our results, we conducted the first formal risk analysis of mitochondrial replacement, and conservatively estimate negative effects in at least one in every 130 resulting offspring born to the therapy.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggest that mitochondrial replacement may routinely affect offspring characteristics across a wide array of animal species, and that such effects are likely to extend to humans. Studies in invertebrate models have confirmed mito-nuclear interactions as the underpinning cause of organismal effects following mitochondrial replacement. This therefore suggests that mito-nuclear interactions are also likely to be contributing to effects seen in biomedical studies, on vertebrate models, whose effect sizes exceeded those of biological studies. Our results advocate the use of safeguards that could offset any negative effects (defining any unintended effect as being negative) mediated by mito-nuclear interactions following mitochondrial replacement in humans, such as mitochondrial genetic matching between donor and recipient. Our results also suggest that further research into the molecular nature of mito-nuclear interactions would be beneficial in refining the clinical application of mitochondrial replacement, and in establishing what degree of variation between donor and patient mitochondrial DNA haplotypes is acceptable to ensure 'haplotype matching'.

AB Utilizing dual logic from a multiple goals and relational turbulence theory, this study examined parents-in-law's interaction goals for topic avoidance with their children-in-law. Data from 159 parents-in-law revealed that multiple and conflicting goals were associated with parents-in-law's topic avoidance. Furthermore, relational parameters (i.e., relational uncertainty and partner influence) were associated with the goals in-laws pursued. Results augment theorizing on a multiple goals perspective, relational turbulence, and topic avoidance, as well as theoretically ground the study of in-law communication.

AB Background: Chronically ill persons experience conditions of life that can become unbearable, resulting in the wish to end their life prematurely. Relatives confronted with this wish experience ambivalence between loyalty to the person's desire to die and the fear of losing this person. Caring for a person during the premature dying process can be morally challenging for nurses. One way to end one's life prematurely is Voluntary Stopping of Eating and Drinking (VSED).
   Methods: This embedded single case study explored the experiences of registered nurses (embedded units of analysis: ward manager, nursing manager, nursing expert) and relatives who accompanied a 49-year-old woman suffering from multiple sclerosis during VSED in a Swiss long-term care institution (main unit of analysis). By means of a within-analysis, we performed an in-depth analysis of every embedded unit of analysis and elaborated a central phenomenon for each unit. Afterwards, we searched for common patterns in a cross-analysis of the embedded units of analysis in order to develop a central model.
   Results: The following central concept emerged from cross-analysis of the embedded units of analysis: As a way of ending one's life prematurely, VSED represents an unfamiliar challenge to nurses and relatives in the field of tension between one's personal attitude and the agents' concerns, fears and uncertainties. Particularly significant is the personal attitude, influenced on the one hand by one's own experiences, prior knowledge, role and faith, on the other hand by the VSED-performing person's age, disease and deliberate communication of the decision. Depending on the intention of VSED as either suicide or natural dying, an accepting or dismissing attitude evolves on an institutional and personal level.
   Conclusions: To deal professionally with VSED in an institution, it is necessary to develop an attitude on the institutional and personal level. Educational measures and quality controls are required to ensure that VSED systematically becomes an option to hasten death. As VSED is a complex phenomenon, it is necessary to include palliative care in practice development early on and comprehensively. There is a high need of further research on this topic. Particularly, qualitative studies and hypothesis-testing approaches are required.

AB This article addresses the problem of robust stability and stabilization for linear fractional-order system with poly-topic and two-norm bounded uncertainties, and focuses particularly on the case of a fractional order alpha such that 1 < alpha < 2. First, the robust asymptotical stable condition is presented. Second, the design method of the state feedback controller for asymptotically stabilizing such uncertain fractional order systems is derived. In the proposed approach, linear matrix inequalities formalism is used to check and design. Lastly, two simulation examples are given to validate the proposed theoretical results.

AB Zeotropic mixtures and turbine expander were two hot topics in organic Rankine cycle (ORC) field recently. However, few researches referred the design of turbine expander with zeotropic mixtures. In this paper, R245fa, R123 and three mixtures (0.25R245fa/0.75R123, 0.5R245fa/0.5R123, 0.75R245fa/0.25R123) are used as working fluid to investigate the performance of a partially admitted turbine consisting of 3 nozzles and 30 blades. The mean-line diameter of turbine is 0.1 m and the height of blade is 14 mm. The 3D simulation are carried out with ANSYS CFX using k-omega turbulence model and SRK real gas model. Results show that turbine has maximum power output of 8.1336 kW and maximum efficiency of 55.3% with pure R245fa used as working fluid. When the mass fraction of R245fa is 0.25, mixture has the maximum glide temperature of 3 K, while turbine has maximum power output gain of 7.87%, maximum mass flow rate gain of 3.57%, maximum Ma number of 2.19 and maximum mass flow rate of 0.5287 kg/s. The results of system analysis coupling with the designed turbine show that the maximum thermal efficiency, maximum net work and minimum exergy destruction factor are 6.15%, 7.6771 kW and 2.41 respectively for the best working condition.

AB This paper introduces a multi-period, multi-product green inventory routing problem with transshipment option, where capacitated vehicles distribute products from multiple suppliers to one customer to meet the given demand of products. The demand associated with the customer is assumed to be time-varying and deterministic. Greenhouse gas emissions from transport activities in a supply chain are a main reason for global warming. One of the main types of greenhouse gas is CO2 from vehicles and its impact on the environment. Inventory and routing decisions can help in the reduction of CO2 emissions if these emissions are taken into account by researchers. Also, as one of the main topics of this paper, the transshipment option is considered in the proposed model. The model is a mixed-integer programming (MIP) which has been solved and validated by General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). Finally, small and large-scale test problems are randomly generated and solved by the simulated annealing algorithm (SA). The computational results for different test problems showed that the proposed SA performs well and converges fast to reasonable solutions compared with GAMS. According to the results, it is determined that the transshipment option reduces CO2 emissions and costs by shortening the distance traveled.

AB The evaluation of results of forensic genetic analyses given activity level propositions is an emerging discipline in forensic genetics. Although it is a topic with a long history, it has never been considered to be such a critically important topic for the field, as today. With the increasing sensitivity of analysis techniques, and advances in data interpretation using probabilistic models ('probabilistic genotyping'), there is an increasing demand on forensic biologists to share specialised knowledge to help recipients of expert information address mode and timing of transfer and persistence of traces in court. Scientists thereby have a critical role in the assessment of their findings in the context of the case. This helps the judiciary with activity level inferences in a balanced, robust and transparent way, when based on (1) proper case assessment and interpretation respecting the hierarchy of propositions (supported by, for example, the use of Bayesian networks as graphical models), (2) use of appropriate data to inform probabilities, and (3) reporting guidelines by international bodies. This critical review of current literature shows that with certain prerequisites for training and quality assurance, there is a solid foundation for evidence interpretation when propositions of interest are at the 'activity level'.

AB Aim: Understanding the roles of allopatric fragmentation and niche divergence in intraspecific lineage diversification is central to our comprehension of how new species arise and evolve. Here we integrate an extensive multilocus dataset with species distribution models to address these topics in genetically differentiated population lineages of the common midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans).
   Location: Iberian Peninsula, Western Europe.
   Methods: We genotyped 965 individuals from 142 localities at 12 microsatellite loci to finely delineate the ranges of population lineages in A. obstetricans. We then built ecological niche-based models for each lineage and tested for niche overlap, equivalency and similarity based on PCA-env analyses. We also investigated the relationship between genetic and environmental distances across lineages.
   Results: We recovered seven differentiated genetic clusters, with mostly different (sometimes nonoverlapping) niches. However, niches are not more divergent than expected given the largely allopatric ranges of population lineages. We found no significant isolation by environment within lineages, with genetic distances mostly explained by geographical distances.
   Main conclusions: Allopatric fragmentation in A. obstetricans resulted in (sometimes highly) different niches in intraspecific population lineages. Within lineages, isolation by distance is the major driver of patterns of genetic variation. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating intraspecific genetic structure into species distribution models to explore spatial patterns of genetic diversity in terms of their underlying processes.

AB In this essay, I provide an overview of the debate on infinite and essential idealizations in physics. I will first present two ostensible examples: phase transitions and the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Then, I will describe the literature on the topic as a debate between two positions: Essentialists claim that idealizations are essential or indispensable for scientific accounts of certain physical phenomena, while dispensabilists maintain that idealizations are dispensable from mature scientific theory. I will also identify some attempts at finding a middle ground between the essentialists and dispensabilists camps. Finally, I will raise questions for future research on essential and infinite idealizations via the notion of exploration.

ID VIEWS
AB With the goal of understanding how Christopher Southgate communicates his in-depth knowledge of both science and theology, we investigated the many roles he assumes as a teacher. We settled upon wide-ranging topics that all intertwine: (1) his roles as author and coordinating editor of a premier textbook on science and theology, now in its third edition; (2) his oral presentations worldwide, including plenaries, workshops, and short courses; and (3) the team teaching approach itself, which is often needed by others because the knowledge of science and theology do not always reside in the same person. Southgate provides, whenever possible, teaching contexts that involve students in experiential learning, where they actively participate with other students. We conclude that Southgate's ultimate goal is to teach students how to reconcile science and theology in their values and beliefs, so that they can take advantage of both forms of rational thinking in their own personal and professional lives. The co-authors consider several examples of models that have been successfully used by people in various fields to integrate science and religion.

TI Chief Resident Immersion Training in the Care of Older Adults: A
   Successful National Replication of an Interspecialty Educational
   Intervention
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Purpose
   Nongeriatricians must acquire skills and knowledge in geriatric medicine to ensure coordinated care of older adults' complex conditions by interspecialty and interprofessional teams. Chief residents (CRs) are an ideal target for an educational intervention. This study examined whether the Boston Medical Center Chief Resident Immersion Training (CRIT) in the Care of Older Adults was replicable at diverse medical institutions.
   Method
   Between 2008 and 2010, 12 institutions in 11 states received funding, technical support, and a common program model. Each implemented 2.5-day CRITs, consisting of a patient case, geriatrics-related lectures, CR leadership sessions, action project planning, and networking time. Site faculty conducted 21 CRITs for 295 CRs representing 28 specialties. CRs completed knowledge pre- and posttests, and self-report baseline and six-month follow-up surveys. Outcome measures were change in pre- and posttest score, and change from baseline to six months in self-reported surveys.
   Results
   Response rate for CRs was 99% (n = 293) for the pre-post tests and 78% (n = 231) for matchable baseline and follow-up surveys. Participants' knowledge increased from 6.32 to 8.39 (P < .001) averaged from 12 questions. CRs' self-reported ability to apply clinical problem-solving skills to older patients (P < .001), number of geriatrics topics taught (P < .001), frequency of geriatrician consultations (P = .017), confidence in leadership skills (P < .001), and confidence to conduct CR work (P < .001) increased from baseline to follow-up.
   Conclusions
   CRIT is an innovative way to give nongeriatricians knowledge and skills to treat complex older patients.

AB Semisupervised and unsupervised systems provide operators with invaluable support and can tremendously reduce the operators' load. In the light of the necessity to process large volumes of video data and provide autonomous decisions, this paper proposes new learning algorithms for activity analysis in video. The activities and behaviors are described by a dynamic topic model. Two novel learning algorithms based on the expectation maximization approach and variational Bayes inference are proposed. Theoretical derivations of the posterior estimates of model parameters are given. The designed learning algorithms are compared with the Gibbs sampling inference scheme introduced earlier in the literature. A detailed comparison of the learning algorithms is presented on real video data. We also propose an anomaly localization procedure, elegantly embedded in the topic modeling framework. It is shown that the developed learning algorithms can achieve 95% success rate. The proposed framework can be applied to a number of areas, including transportation systems, security, and surveillance.

AB Big data research has become a globally hot topic in recent years. One of the core problems in big data learning is how to extract effective information from the huge data. In this paper, we propose a Markov resampling algorithm to draw useful samples for handling coefficient-based regularized regression (CBRR) problem. The proposed Markov resampling algorithm is a selective sampling method, which can automatically select uniformly ergodic Markov chain (u.e.M.c.) samples according to transition probabilities. Based on u.e.M.c. samples, we analyze the theoretical performance of CBRR algorithm and generalize the existing results on independent and identically distributed observations. To be specific, when the kernel is infinitely differentiable, the learning rate depending on the sample size m can be arbitrarily close to O(m(-1)) under a mild regularity condition on the regression function. The good generalization ability of the proposed method is validated by experiments on simulated and real data sets.

   ontology; reality; the real
AB The present article concentrates on the main discrepancies that should arise in the discussion between Lotman's semiotics of culture and Laclau's discursive theory of hegemony. Some significant - but still abstract - commonalities conceal fundamental disagreements which I would group around four topics. Firstly, Lotman's semiotic method is at odds with Laclau's ontological way of thinking. Secondly, although both Lotman and Laclau subscribe to the openness of signification, it is impossible to incorporate their accounts of this openness without loose ends. In order to substantiate this claim, I examine Lotman's concept of "boundary" and Laclau's concept of the "limit." Thirdly, we should avoid reading too much into Lotman and Laclau's agreement on the similar - but still formal - model of a self-signification. And finally, Laclau's valorization of social antagonism is in conflict with Lotman's appraisal of dialogue. Confronted with these discrepancies, we are enforced to decide whether to endorse Lotman's cultural semiotics or Laclau's political ontology.

AB In past decades, a relevant strand of literature has found corruption to be an important determinant of income inequality. In this paper, it is argued that a reverse causal relationship between corruption and income inequality might exist. We claim that income inequality could in fact be responsible for fostering corruption, which may be a reaction to a perceived unfair income distribution. Looking at a panel of 50 countries from 1995-2015, we show that the direction of causality between corruption and income inequality is country-specific and may be bidirectional. Using a dynamic GMM model, we robustly find that income inequality positively affects corruption, while corruption does not appear to be significant in the determination of income inequality, therefore contradicting the existing empirical literature on this topic.

AB The mechanism of resistance switching memory effect has always been a focused scientific topic. In this work, a new resistance conversion mechanism is put forward in a resistance switching device with sandwich structure, in which the Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) is used as active layer and the F-doped SnO2 (FTO) and Al-doped ZnO (AZO) acts the top and bottom electrode, respectively. Through further in-depth study, an optimal memory effect in the FTO/CZTSe/AZO device is observed when the thickness of CZTSe film is similar to 200 nm (d(CZTSe) = 200 nm). Finally, the memory characteristics of the resistance switching device is clarified in detail by using a physical model based on the tunneling of carrier at the Schottky barrier which are formed on the FTO/CZTSe and CZTSe/AZO interfaces.

AB This article establishes and examines occupational therapists' role in perinatal care and proposes a health promotion approach for new and expectant mothers. The author demonstrates the importance of maintaining meaningful occupational engagement during this critical life stage by incorporating evidence from orthopedic, rehabilitation, and hand therapy research. New and expectant mothers are at high risk for upper extremity (UE) conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome, De Quervain's tenosynovitis, and tendinosis of the UE. Occupational therapists with basic knowledge of hand therapy are well prepared to manage these conditions conservatively. An occupation-based model and framework are presented to ensure a holistic view of the target population. Topics pertinent to this population include postural techniques, repetitive tasks, patient education, and strengthening related to the perinatal period.

AB Integrated fiber-wireless (FiWi) multi-robot networks will play a pivotal role in ensuring QoS for several human-to-robot (H2R) applications due to their coverage and capacity advantages. For the successful deployment of H2R applications, efficient task allocation among robots is essential, which has emerged as an interesting research topic by taking into account a wide variety of task and robot types, task location, robot availability, capability, and failure during task execution. To render the task allocation process more efficient, we propose a task allocation scheme for FiWi-based multi-robot networks according to several key design parameters such as the availability, skill set, distance to task location, and remaining energy of robots. Furthermore, to reduce failures during task execution, we introduce a neighboring robot-assisted failure reporting mechanism. We develop an analytical model to evaluate the network performance in terms of throughput, task allocation delay, execution time, and residual energy. In addition, we analyze the end-to-end delay performance for both local and nonlocal task allocation in integrated FiWi multi-robot networks. Our results show that minimum execution time-based selection outperforms traditional minimum distance and priority-based selection in terms of total task execution time and average residual energy.

AB Systems thinking characterizes the paradigm needed to effectively design, maintain, and utilize systems. Prior work has shown that there is a language of systems thinking and that its presence can be quantified within text using supervised learning methods. Building on this foundation, we present a human-in-the-loop methodology that utilizes topic models to facilitate the identification of systems thinking within a corpus of documents. Though explorative, it requires no manual grading of documents, which makes it significantly faster than previous methods. The methodology uses each document's topic proportion within a systems thinking topic as a proxy measure for the potential of strong systems thinking. The novel aspect of the methodology is in the seeding of the corpus; the user encourages the emergence of the systems thinking topic by adding several documents that demonstrate strong systems thinking to the corpus. Additionally, seeding could he used with concepts other than systems thinking. A Tukey test on a graded corpus reveals that the top echelons of strong systems thinking papers have significantly higher mean topic proportions in the systems thinking topic than lower graded papers. Additionally, a case study on a corpus of Army documents related to the development, character, and management of soldiers demonstrates the methodology's effectiveness in overviewing a system and in providing research direction. The definition of strong systems thinking and the interpretation of topics are subjective, but the methodology overcomes this hurdle by leveraging human intuition and keeping a human in the loop.

AB In this brief, the distributed bipartite tracking consensus problem for linear multi-agent systems (MASs) in the presence of a single leader is investigated. Compared with some related works on this topic, the leader's control inputs in the present MAS model are allowed to be nonzero and unknown to each follower. To guarantee bipartite tracking consensus, a new kind of distributed non-smooth protocols based on the relative state information of neighboring agents are proposed and analyzed. With the help of tools from Lyapunov stability theory and graph theory, it is shown that bipartite tracking consensus in the close-loop MAS can be achieved if the gain matrix of protocol is suitably constructed and the control parameters of protocol are, respectively, larger than some positive quantities depending on global information of the considered MAS. To provide some efficient criteria for consensus seeking without involving any global information, some fully distributed protocols with adaptive control parameters are further designed and discussed. Finally, numerical simulations are given for illustration.

AB This paper addresses the analysis of three-phase squirrel-cage induction machine (IM) with interturn short-circuit (ITSC) fault and its influence on direct torque control (DTC). The particularities of the DTC such as its behavior, its standard heuristic derivation, and its nature of been a nonlinear hysteresis-based predictive controller are exploited, thus allowing the improvement and development of alternative explanations to the phenomena. The understanding of DTC and the development of the current state-space model of the asymmetric IM, presented here for first time in the literature, enables the analytical treatment of the research topic and the discovery of several DTC reactions to the fault. The ITSC impact on DTC and its reaction leads to the following twofold characterizations: first, unobservable and visible effects, and second, compensation and tolerant reactions. For purposes of simulation, a plug-and-play configurable circuit-block for the asymmetric IM was developed based on Norton's equivalent circuit. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the assertiveness of the developed analyses and theoretical findings, which allows future research in online fault diagnostics and condition monitoring of inverter-fed IM with this type of fault.

AB As emerging markets gain significance in the global economy, understanding the middle-class customers within these dynamic economies becomes even more critical for international marketers. This article contributes to the limited but growing literature on this topic. International marketing scholars and practitioners should be better informed about this megatrend. What does the "middle class" really mean? What are the theoretical underpinnings for the middle-class phenomenon? What are the implications for international marketing? To address these pressing questions, the authors explore the middle-class phenomenon in emerging markets. Through an examination of conceptual underpinnings and empirical observations, they present a conceptualization and several theoretical propositions. Finally, they provide managerial and scholarly implications of the middle-class phenomenon and offer suggestions for further research.

AB Workplace bullying (WB) is an increasingly prevalent topic in the nursing literature. Recently, a new concept has been introduced into WB research to explain the motivations of WB instigators using elements of the Power-Control Wheel (PCW). Initially, this wheel was designed to assist intimate partner violence (IPV) targets/victims identify patterns of abuse and intervene with male batterers/instigators. Research examining IPV and victims/survivors of WB demonstrate that targets often share common abusive experiences, including intimidation, coercion and threats, isolation, and economic and emotional abuse. This article demonstrates clear support for the Duluth Model and its application to WB target experiences. Applications of this model to identify WB and assist individuals to identify and describe experiences of abusive work environments are discussed.

AB Human children, in contrast to other species, are frequently cast as prolific over-imitators. However, previous studies of over-imitation have overlooked many important real-world social dynamics, and may thus provide an inaccurate account of this seemingly puzzling and potentially maladaptive phenomenon. Here we investigate this topic using a cultural evolutionary approach, focusing particularly on the key adaptive learning strategy of majority-biased copying. Most over-imitation research has been conducted using consistent demonstrations to the observer, but we systematically varied the frequency of demonstrators that 4- to 6-year-old children observed performing a causally irrelevant action. Children who over-imitate inflexibly should copy the majority regardless of whether the majority solution omits or includes a causally irrelevant action. However, we found that children calibrated their tendency to acquire the majority behavior, such that copying did not extend to majorities that performed irrelevant actions. These results are consistent with a highly functional, adaptive integration of social and causal information, rather than explanations implying unselective copying or causal misunderstanding. This suggests that our species might be better characterized as broadly optimal- rather than over- imitators.

AB Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are two incurable diseases both hallmarked by an abnormal deposition of the amyloidogenic peptides A beta and Islet Amyloid Polypeptide (IAPP) in affected tissues. Epidemiological data demonstrate that patients suffering from diabetes are at high risk of developing AD, thus making the search for factors common to the two pathologies of special interest for the design of new therapies. Accumulating evidence suggests that the toxic properties of both A beta or IAPP are ascribable to their ability to damage the cell membrane. However, the molecular details describing A beta or IAPP interaction with membranes are poorly understood. This review focuses on biophysical and in silico studies addressing these topics. Effects of calcium, cholesterol and membrane lipid composition in driving aberrant A beta or LAPP interaction with the membrane will be specifically considered. The cross correlation of all these factors appears to be a key issue not only to shed light in the countless and often controversial reports relative to this area but also to gain valuable insights into the central events leading to membrane damage caused by amyloidogenic peptides. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Protein Aggregation and Misfolding at the Cell Membrane Interface edited by Ayyalusamy Ramamoorthy.

   PERSPECTIVE; WOMEN; CARE
AB Purpose of Review While third-line therapies for overactive bladder and urgency urinary incontinence are well-described in guideline statements, there is little offered in guidance when it comes to selecting a particular intervention amongst these therapies for patients. Data regarding efficacy has a body of literature that takes sides on all fronts, making efficacy of these interventions a topic of continued debate. An ever-present factor for consideration also remains-cost of therapy. This review examines current data available for cost of third-line therapies.
   Recent Findings In this body of literature regarding cost, there too remains ongoing debate, with no definitive answer. Data appears to support bladder Botox treatment being less costly in the short term (under 5 years), while sacral neuromodulation may have increased cost-effectiveness in the long-term (between 5 and 10 years). Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation may be more cost-effective than sacral neuromodulation in the long-term, but has the associated challenges of patients needing to be present in offices at regular intervals for treatment duration. The generalizability of this data is limited by cost models being conducted in different countries, with varying healthcare systems and intervention techniques.
   Summary Therapies of the future, such as rechargeable technologies for sacral neuromodulation, appear to offer cost-saving opportunities that could impact therapy decision making in years to come. Rechargeable systems could significantly decrease the associated cost of sacral neuromodulation therapies. Ultimately, intangible clinical factors that influence patient care should still drive decision making and not be superseded by perceived treatment costs, especially as a definitive understanding regarding this remains elusive.

AB Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a devastating complication after total joint replacement. A main source for antibiotic tolerance and treatment failure is bacterial production of biofilm-a resilient barrier against antibiotics, immune system, and mechanical debridement. The purpose of this review is to explore some novel approaches to treat PJI and biofilm-related infections.
   Innovative treatment strategies of bacterial and biofilm infections revolve around (a) augmenting current therapies, such as improving the delivery and efficiency of conventional antibiotics and enhancing the efficacy of antiseptics and (b) administrating completely new therapeutic modalities, such as using immunotherapy, nanoparticles, lytic bacteriophages, photodynamic therapy, novel antibiotics, and antimicrobial peptides.
   Several promising treatment strategies for PJI are available to be tested further. The next requirement for most of the novel treatments is reproducing their effects in clinically representative animal models of PJI against clinical isolates of relevant bacteria.

AB Semantic segmentation of LiDAR and high-resolution aerial imagery is one of the most challenging topics in the remote sensing domain. Deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and its derivatives have recently shown the abilities in pixel-wise prediction of remote sensing data. Many existing deep learning methods fuse LiDAR and high-resolution aerial imagery towards an inter-modal mode and thus overlook the intra-modal statistical characteristics. Additionally, the patch-based CNNs could generate the salt-and-pepper artifacts as characterized by isolated and spurious pixels on the object boundaries and patch edges leading to unsatisfied labelling results. This paper presents a semantic segmentation scheme that combines multi-filter CNN and multi-resolution segmentation (MRS). The multi-filter CNN aggregates LiDAR data and high-resolution optical imagery by multi modal data fusion for semantic labelling, and the MRS is further used to delineate object boundaries for reducing the salt-and-pepper artifacts. The proposed method is validated against two datasets: the ISPRS 2D semantic labelling contest of Potsdam and an area of Guangzhou in China labelled based on existing geodatabases. Various designs of data fusion strategy, CNN architecture and MRS scale are analyzed and discussed. Compared with other classification methods, our method improves the overall accuracies. Experiment results show that our combined method is an efficient solution for the semantic segmentation of LiDAR and high-resolution imagery.

AB Mobile Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds have the characteristics of complex and incomplete scenes, uneven point density and noises, which raises great challenges for automatically interpreting 3D scene. Aiming at the problem of 3D point cloud classification, we propose a probabilistic graphical model for automatic classification of mobile LiDAR point clouds in this paper. First, the super-voxels are generated as primitives based on the similar geometric and radiometric properties. Second, we construct point-based multi-scale visual features that are used to describe the texture information at various scales. Third, the topic model is used to analyze the semantic correlations among points within super-voxels to establish the semantic representation, which is finally fed into the proposed probabilistic graphical model. The proposed model combines Bayesian network and Markov random fields to obtain locally continuous and globally optimal classification results. To evaluate the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted using mobile LiDAR point clouds for three types of street scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model is efficient and robust for extracting vehicles, buildings, street trees and pole-like objects, with overall accuracies of 98.17%, 97.41% and 96.81% respectively. Moreover, compared with other existing methods, our proposed model can provide higher classification correctness, specifically for small objects such as cars and pole-like objects.

AB Recent publications in Nature, Science, and other journals raised concerns about the reproducibility of empirical findings in psychology and other scientific disciplines. This article summarizes some of these arguments and results that led to discussions about a "replication crisis" in research. In criminology, there is not yet a similar discussion, although the need for more replications has been emphasized in the past. The present article addresses this topic with special consideration of program evaluations in early developmental crime prevention and offender treatment. In both fields, there has been substantial progress in research and practice. Most systematic reviews showed mean positive effects; however, nearly all of them demonstrated very heterogeneous findings that could not be attributed to the content of programs. This does not allow simple recommendations of "what works" for policy-making and practice. In addition, there is a serious lack of long-term follow-ups and independent evaluations. The article shows remarkable similarity of the findings and problems in both fields of intervention. Problems of reproducibility prove to be highly relevant for criminology, although there is no need for using the term "crisis". The article proposes various strategies that can enhance the reproducibility of findings, i.e., more systematic investigation of those differentiated conditions under which interventions are most effective. An integrative model of relevant characteristics is briefly presented. It refers to factors of the programs, contexts, participants, and evaluation methods. Confirmatory meta-analyses can play an important role on the path toward more differentiated and replicated knowledge.

AB How do outfielders control their locomotor behavior in running to catch fly balls? This question has been the topic of many empirical studies. It is interesting that a little addressed but highly relevant issue in this regard is that of the influence of perceived catchability on locomotor control. We examined what factors determine catchability and whether catchability can be reliably perceived. We had participants run to catch fly balls that could either be catchable or uncatchable. Participants performed two tasks. In the catching task, they were instructed to attempt to catch the ball and to keep running even when they felt that a ball was uncatchable. In the judging task, they were instructed to call "no" as soon as they perceived a ball to be uncatchable. Using Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Regression (GLMER) on data from the catching task, we modeled catchability, identifying five behaviorally relevant agent-environment variables that together explained 84.4% of the variance in catching performance. Next, we examined whether judgments of catchability were accurate. Using the GLMER-model, the catchability of every fly ball in the judging task was predicted and subsequently compared with participants' judgments. Participants were able to correctly judge the catchability of a fly ball on 85.4% of the trials. It is interesting that participants' judgments of fly balls to be uncatchable most often were given only after they had started running. Present findings provide a valuable step toward the formalization of an affordance-based control strategy for running to catch fly balls.

AB The current research topic on modeling continuum manipulators are shifting toward the development of accurate dynamic models by considering more specificities and mechanical properties. In this paper, we present a dynamic modeling of a class of continuum manipulators namely driving-cables robots based on the Euler-Lagrange method. The dynamic model is developed based on the kinematic equations of inextensible bending section with zero torsion and by using the constant curvature assumption. Taylor expansion has been applied to the geometric model in order to avoid singularities and reduce the complexity of the mathematical expressions. At the end, some simulation results are presented showing the static equilibrium as well as the dynamic behavior. In addition, a classic Proportional-Integrated-Derivative (PID) controller is proposed to ensure tracking trajectories using the point-to-point technique.

AB Context: Evolving practices, accreditation, and priorities established in Public Health 3.0 are adding to the long-identified need for management training among public health practitioners.
   Program: The New England Public Health Training Center is addressing this need with a flexible, open-source, 16-topic training program. The program is designed to build competencies for current and future managers, preparing them for their day-to-day tasks and for the kinds of adaptation suggested by Public Health 3.0 advocates.
   Implementation: The training program uses live expert instructors for 10 webinars and 2 in-person trainings. Experts have also created the content for multiple self-paced E-Learnings that trainees undertake in addition to the instructor-led sessions. A webinar platform with breakout rooms and an advanced learning management system allows for online discussion and mentor interaction. The course has now been offered, evaluated, and modified 3 times, and the materials are available for noncommercial use by the public health community.
   Evaluation: Using the Kirkpatrick training evaluation model, the recent cohort was satisfied (87.5%) with the training, reported identifying actions to apply information learned to their work (85.8%), and experienced statistically significant knowledge gains. Earlier trainees reported work-related behavior change.
   Discussion: Management training offers the hope of increasing professionalism; creating better, more effective workplaces and programs; and preparing practitioners for an evolving public health landscape. Early results indicate that NEPHTC's program, Managing Effectively in Today's Public Health Environment, is a useful tool in realizing that hope.

AB Obesity is a complex system problem involving a broad spectrum of policy, social, economic, cultural, environmental, behavioural, and biological factors and the complex interrelated, cross-sector, non-linear, dynamic relationships among them. Systems modelling is an innovative approach with the potential for advancing obesity research. This study examined the applications of systems modelling in obesity research published between 2000 and 2017, examined how the systems models were developed and used in obesity studies and discussed related gaps in current research. We focused on the applications of two main systems modelling approaches: system dynamics modelling and agent-based modelling. The past two decades have seen a growing body of systems modelling in obesity research. The research topics ranged from micro-level to macro-level energy-balance-related behaviours and policies (19 studies), population dynamics (five studies), policy effect simulations (eight studies), environmental (10 studies) and social influences (15 studies) and their effects on obesity rates. Overall, systems analysis in public health research is still in its early stages, with limitations linked to model validity, mixed findings and its actual use in guiding interventions. Challenges in theory and modelling practices need to be addressed to realize the full potential of systems modelling in future obesity research and interventions.

AB In this work we present the modelling of InxGa1-xAs/InzGa1-zAs/In y 1-y Ga As metamorphic quantum dot nanostructures. These are of great recent interest as the active materials in single photon devices emitting in the telecom windows. We have calculated: (i) strain-dependent energy band profiles, (ii) ground energy levels for electrons and heavy holes, (iii) carrier probability densities and (iv) oscillation strenghts for radiative recombination for structures where the In composition in the metamorphic buffer x and in the cap layer y were varied. The modelization has been carried out using the TiberCAD software on the basis of realistic parameters and results have been compared against experimental photoluminescence data: such a comparison shows that the calculated and experimental values agree within a 10 meV interval. Simulations show that in the metamorphic quantum dot (QD) system, a Type-II quantum confinement regime can occurr for particular values of x and y, a feature not reported so far for In(Ga)As QDs. Furthermore, we have been able to identify an optimized design for 10 K light emission at 1.55 mu m with the highest emission efficiency. These results will be useful to improve the design and the preparation of QD nanostructures for single photon emission in the telecom windows, a topic of high relevance for the upcoming quantum technology revolution.

AB It is commonly asserted that economic liberalization increases income inequality in advanced industrial societies. However, the empirical evidence is inconclusive. The current investigation thus attempts to shed light on this important topic by presenting the argument that economic liberalization indirectly augments income inequality given its tendency to expand financial activity. This contention is tested using a panel dataset of 20 developed economies for the years 1988 to 2009. According to the fixed effects two-stage least squares models, economic liberalization is positively associated with financialization, while financial activity is positively connected to income inequality. These results are found to be consistent across a variety of regression parameters and robustness checks.

ID NESTED LOGIT MODEL; TRAVEL MODE; NEURAL-NETWORKS; BEHAVIOR
AB The modeling of travel decision making has been a popular topic in transportation planning. Previous studies focused on random-utility discrete choice models and machine learning methods. This paper proposes a new modeling approach that utilizes a mixed Bayesian network (BN) for travel decision inference. The authors use a predetermined BN structure and calculate priori and posterior probability distributions of the decision alternatives based on the observed explanatory variables. As a "utility-free" decision inference method, the BN model releases the linear structure in the utility function but assumes the traffic level of service variables follow multivariate Gaussian distribution conditional on the choice variable. A real-world case study is conducted by using the regional travel survey data for a two-dimensional decision modeling of both departure time choice and travel mode choice. The results indicate that a two-dimensional mixed BN provides better accuracy than decision tree models and nested logit models. In addition, one can derive continuous elasticity with respect to each continuous explanatory variable for sensitivity analysis. This new approach addresses a research gap in probabilistic travel decision making modeling as well as two-dimensional travel decision modeling.

AB Few studies have addressed the topic of farmers' adaptation to climate change from a multidisciplinary perspective, because of the difficulty in assessing their impacts. In view of the growing concern in the agricultural sector on this issue, we analyzed farm-level adaptation through amble land-use changes in the specific case of the Loam region in Belgium. With this aim, we used an agro-economic model which considered 20-year series of current and projected simulated yields with and without considering additional farming practices to reduce crop stress, such as irrigation and soil and water conservation techniques. Agronomic results show that climate change will negatively affect summer crop yields, particularly sugar beet and potatoes. However, we also show that adaptation to climate change through land-use changes can compensate for crop yield losses and lead to utility gains. These are obtained by reducing the share of land allocated to summer crops and barley and by increasing the surface allocated to less vulnerable crops such as winter wheat Finally, irrigation practices would not be justified in the Loam region under climate change, since their use would incur important financial costs for farmers.

AB Due to a simultaneous decline in agricultural practice and an increased favorability and demand by society, grazing based milk production has become a topic of heightened interest in European agricultural policy, as well as dairy product marketing. This paper studies the behavior of German farmers with respect to the adoption of grazing practices. To do so, a structural equation model based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) is developed. Generally, the TAM hypothesizes that the perceived usefulness and the perceived ease of use are key determinants of the intention to use and the actual usage behavior of a technology. The results indicate that the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use statistically significantly influence the adoption of grazing practices. Other important aspects are the production limitations on the individual farm, and the farmers' subjective norm towards grazing. Furthermore, the analysis reveals differences between conventional and organic farmers, showing that the influence of farmers' beliefs on the usage behavior tends to be greater for conventional farmers. The results show that farmers' subjective norm influences multiple other constructs of the model, including the intention to use. Under the assumption that farmers' perceptions of societal expectations depend on the public discourse, this indicates the relevance of public information and communication for the farmer's decision-making processes.

AB Background: A better understanding of the modulation of the immune system has resulted in the development of new classes of antitumor agents such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Despite the proven effectiveness and tolerability of these new drugs for specific types of cancer, the high cost of treatment has affected their accessibility.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to conduct a meta-narrative review of studies that have addressed the concerns that have been voiced regarding the cost of and access to nivolumab and pembrolizumab in oncology health care. This meta-narrative review attempts to answer the following questions: (1) which papers have considered this broad topic area?; (2) what are the main empirical/theoretical findings?; and (3) what insights can be drawn by combining and comparing findings from different papers?
   Methods and data source: A meta-narrative review has been conducted in 5 research databases (Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, Embase and Pubmed) without time limitations up to January of 2017 to address concerns related to the cost of and access to nivolumab and pembrolizumab in oncology health care. From each research base, articles were selected that had a key word related to the theme of pharmacoeconomics and nivolumab or pembrolizumab in any field of scientific work. The research questions were analyzed through the application of a meta-narrative review approach and the use of a convergence-coding matrix to summarize similarities and differences directly related to the research topic between the different papers.
   Key findings: The first contribution of this meta-narrative review is that it summarizes economic-based works on the use of nivolumab and pembrolizumab, particularly for three therapeutic indications: melanoma, NSCLC and RCC. In general, despite the clinical benefit of nivolumab and pembrolizumab being well accepted and proven by scientific works, the published studies show that there are contradictory results with regard to the cost-effectiveness of these anti-PD-1s. The regulatory, economic and epidemiological variations mean that healthcare costs for cancer patients vary greatly from country to country and according to the type of tumor. The second contribution has to do with the recommendations for the development of high quality process for pharmacoeconomic analyses, especially in the new field of immuno-oncology. Finally, the third contribution is with regard to recommendations for the sustainable use of immunotherapies.
   Conclusions: Given the revolution in cancer therapy in recent years, the efficient allocation of existing resources is essential for healthcare systems to meet the evolving needs of populations and remain sustainable in the long term. The application of high quality information that stems from scientific evidence and economic modeling can help considerably to make the healthcare system sustainable over time mainly due to a higher number of therapeutic indications or more countries giving regulatory approval for the use of new and expensive cancer drugs.

AB In Tanzania, a nation with a large mental health treatment gap, local stakeholders' perspectives are critical for informing effective treatment. The practice-based perspectives of mental health providers may be particularly instructive. Existing foundational literature on the professional population in this region is scarce. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 29 mental health providers in northern Tanzania. Interviews focused on three topics: use of international diagnostic frameworks for mental illness, beliefs about causes of mental health concerns, and alternative treatments sought by clients. Interview data were coded and analyzed using consensual qualitative research and the constant comparative method. Usage of diagnostic frameworks varied widely. Providers believed frameworks accurately described many patients but neglected somatic symptoms and contained diagnoses that they had never witnessed. Providers described supernatural and spiritual attributions of mental illness as substantially impacting treatment decisions. Other notable attributions included physical illness, drug/alcohol use, and heredity. Providers reported their clients routinely sought treatment from traditional and spiritual healers prior to seeking care in the formal health system. This study builds a foundation for the ongoing development of the mental health system in northern Tanzania. Findings also support exploration of integrative models of care and task-shifting to incorporate traditional and spiritual beliefs.

AB French historian and literary critic Ren, Girard (1923-2015), most widely known for the concepts of mimetic desire and scapegoating, also engaged in the discussion of the surge of eating disorders in his 1996 essay Eating Disorders and Mimetic Desire. This article explores Girard's ideas on the mimetic nature and origin of eating disorders from a clinical psychiatric perspective and contextualizes them within the field of eating disorders research as well as in relation to broader psychological, sociological and anthropological models of social comparison and non-consumption. Three main themes in Girard's thinking on the topic of eating disorders are identified and explored: the 'end of prohibitions' as a driving force in the emergence of eating disorders, eating disorders as a phenomenon specific to modernity, and the significance of 'conspicuous non-consumption' in the emergence of eating disorders.

ID ESTIMATED DSGE MODEL; BORROWING CONSTRAINTS; MONETARY-POLICY
AB In this paper, I shed some light on a much discussed topic in the policy debate: Should national macroprudential policies be supervised by a supranational entity in a monetary union? To do so, I develop a two-country DSGE monetary union model, which I calibrate to the core and periphery regions of the euro area. Monetary policy is set by the ECB, while macroprudential policies, based on the loan-to-value ratio (LW), are set nationally. Results show that, given that the economy in the periphery is more leveraged, macroprudential policies need to be more aggressive in that region. I also find that, when LTV policies are set independently in a non-coordinated manner by each authority, albeit being beneficial for both countries and for the union as a whole, welfare gains are not as high as when they are coordinated and supervised by a separate body.

AB Does domestic contestation of European Union legitimacy affect the behaviour of the European Commission as an economic and fiscal supervisor? We draw on theories of bureaucratic responsiveness and employ multilevel and topic modelling to examine the extent to which the politicisation of European integration affects the outputs of the European Semester: the Country-Specific Recommendations. We develop two competing sets of hypotheses and test these on an original large-N data set on Commission behaviour with observations covering the period 2011-2017. We detect a twofold effect on the Commission's recommendations: member states that experience greater politicisation receive recommendations that are larger in scope but whose substance is less oriented towards social investment. We argue that this effect is best explained as an outcome of the Commission's institutional risk management strategy of regulatory entrenchment'. The supranational agent issues additional recommendations while simultaneously entrenching on a stronger mandate substantively, which allows it to maintain its regulatory reputation and signal regulatory resolve to observing audiences.

AB The theme of genetically modified organisms is very important for modern consumers, especially when they approach novel foods. In this paper, we have attempted to assess the impact of genetically modified foods on the consumers' preferences, considering a new vision of ours: however, the conclusions also form a topic for further discussion. We conducted an investigation on a sample size survey. The analysis was carried out in a representative sample of more than 900 Italian families, selected based on a functional relationship to the objectives of the work. The aims of the present study were: firstly, investigating consumers' preferences regarding genetically modified food consumption and developing a quantitative model to formalize the origins of behaviours regarding consumers' preferences toward genetically modified food consumption; secondly, detecting the drivers of their purchase, underlining that only by reasoning it is possible to ensure that specific variables do not condition purchasing behaviour.

AB Short text streams such as search snippets and micro blogs have been popular on the Web with the emergence of social media. Unlike traditional normal text streams, these data present the characteristics of short length, weak signal, high volume, high velocity, topic drift, etc. Short text stream classification is hence a very challenging and significant task. However, this challenge has received little attention from the research community. Therefore, a new feature extension approach is proposed for short text stream classification with the help of a large-scale semantic network obtained from a Web corpus. It is built on an incremental ensemble classification model for efficiency. First, more semantic contexts based on the senses of terms in short texts are introduced to make up of the data sparsity using the open semantic network, in which all terms are disambiguated by their semantics to reduce the noise impact. Second, a concept cluster-based topic drifting detection method is proposed to effectively track hidden topic drifts. Finally, extensive studies demonstrate that as compared to several well-known concept drifting detection methods in data stream, our approach can detect topic drifts effectively, and it enables handling short text streams effectively while maintaining the efficiency as compared to several state-of-the-art short text classification approaches.

AB The analysis and modelling of the ultimate behaviour of beam-to-column connections is certainly one of the most studied topics in the field of steel structures. In particular, seismic design of steel frames is commonly carried out to assure the dissipation of the seismic input energy in so-called "dissipative zones". The location of such zones depends on the connection ultimate behaviour. Therefore, connections have to be properly detailed in order to assure wide and stable hysteresis loops. Once avoided the yielding of columns, beam-to-column joints play a role of paramount importance. In fact, beam-to-column joints can be designed either as Full Strength (FS) or as Partial Strength (PS). In the first case, depending on the overstrength level, the input seismic energy should be dissipated by means of plastic cyclic excursions of the beam ends. In the second case, dissipation requires the plastic engagement of ductile joint components.
   This paper addresses the design criteria to be adopted to assure full-strength full-ductility behaviour of Unstiffened Extended End-Plate (U-EEP) beam-to-column joints. The validation of the design procedure is accomplished by three-dimensional finite element analyses with ABAQUS 6.13 software. Finally, in order to clarify the design procedure in detail, a worked numerical example concerning the design of an external joint is presented. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Magnetism in dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) has been a controversial topic since its discovery. There are many models which predict the origin of room temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) in TM doped wide band gap semiconductors. Here, we report RTFM in chemically synthesized cubic Zn1-xNixS (0 <= x <= 0.08) DMS nanoparticles of similar to 3-5 nm size. Ferromagnetic behavior (at 300 K and 5 K) was found to increase with the increase in Ni doping concentration and was understood due to defect induced ferromagnetism. The low temperature magnetization measurement (ZFC-FC) shows that the nanoparticles are strongly coupled by magnetic interactions. Optical studies showed decrease in the energy bandgap along with the presence of sulfur and zinc vacancies and surface defects. Low temperature resistivity measurement depicted the semiconducting nature of the synthesized samples. With increase in doping concentration, an increase in the resistive behavior was observed which was explained in the realm of defects states created due to doping of the Ni ions.

ID IMPACT
AB Structural problems are examined with pairing two chambers, one selected by election and the other by sortition, into a traditional bicameral system. It is argued that an all-purpose legislative chamber modeled on existing elected chambers is a mismatch for sortition and that purported benefits of maintaining partisan elections alongside sortition are illusory. Alleged benefits of a hybrid bicameral system are shown to be outweighed by a variety of harmful effects. Furthermore, even if those harms are not substantiated, the continued existence of an elected chamber will likely result in the delimitation of the sortition chamber. Combining many different sorts of minipublics with different characteristics and functions is preferable, and a possible multibody sortition legislative system is presented. Finally, an alternative way forward for sortition is proposed by peeling away individual topic areas from elected bodies and transferring them to sortition bodies.

AB A farmer or a dairy consultant's ability to identify and properly treat lame dairy cows is key to managing lameness on farms. However, this ability is dependent on their knowledge and perceptions regarding lameness. To date these topics are poorly understood in all dairy systems. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses a qualitative approach to describe the perception of lameness in Brazilian pasture-based dairy farms. The aim of this study was firstly, to contextualize farmers and dairy consultants' culture and knowledge on the topic of lameness and, secondly, to understand how these factors may influence lameness management on the farms. Indepth face-to-face semi-structured interviews were done with participating farm owners (n = 21) and dairy consultants (n = 13). Thematic analyses of the interview content provided evidence that the dairy community's overarching culture around lameness acts as a barrier preventing positive actions targeting lameness control and prevention. The emerging themes identified indicate that lameness is a vague, ill-defined concept among both farmers and dairy consultants working in this region. There was a shared belief that pasture-based systems have a low risk for lameness. Furthermore, the prevailing culture for tackling lameness was reactive, particularly in the case of lame cows affected by physical trauma or environmental factors. Treatment was frequently delayed and the misuse of antibiotics was evident. Described community culture was rationalised via the cognitive dissonance and health belief models. We suggest that increased dialogue, including educational efforts within the community, may lead to increased sensitivity of risk perception of lameness within the community and in turn trigger appropriate diagnosis and treatment of lame cows.

AB With the growing popularity of mobile devices (m-devices) and technological advancement in wireless networks, a new form of shopping channel has emerged in the tourism industry. Mobile tourism shopping refers to the use of m-devices to shop for tourism products and services. Given the benefits and potential of this channel, the acceptance however is not widespread and currently an under-addressed topic among academicians. Specifically practitioners are also sceptical if consumers are ready to accept this alternative channel. Drawing upon the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Usage of Technology (UTAUT) as a baseline model, the proposed model was integrated with flow theory, psychological characteristic, social environment and security concern factors to study on the mobile consumers' behavioral intention. Through the use of Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling of 503 mobile respondents, it was discovered that some of the structural paths are not consistent with past literatures. Additionally, a non-parametric permutation approach has also been conducted to discover the gender and age differences in the decision making. The findings however are mixed and therefore require further testing. This study has valuable contributions to academicians, practitioners, and society. Academically, the integrated framework contributes to the tourism and marketing literatures by uniting UTAUT, flow theory, psychological characteristic, social environment and security concern factors. Practically, by focusing on the important factors affecting consumers' decision to adopt mobile tourism shopping, organisations can create effective mobile marketing campaigns. Socially, the study contributes to job creations and revenue generation for the host country.

AB New computational methods and next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches have enabled the use of thousands or hundreds of thousands of genetic markers to address previously intractable questions. The methods and massive marker sets present both new data analysis challenges and opportunities to visualize, understand, and apply population and conservation genomic data in novel ways. The large scale and complexity of NGS data also increases the expertise and effort required to thoroughly and thoughtfully analyze and interpret data. To aid in this endeavor, a recent workshop entitled Population Genomic Data Analysis, also known as ConGen 2017, was held at the University of Montana. The ConGen workshop brought 15 instructors together with knowledge in a wide range of topics including NGS data filtering, genome assembly, genomic monitoring of effective population size, migration modeling, detecting adaptive genomic variation, genomewide association analysis, inbreeding depression, and landscape genomics. Here, we summarize the major themes of the workshop and the important take-home points that were offered to students throughout. We emphasize increasing participation by women in population and conservation genomics as a vital step for the advancement of science. Some important themes that emerged during the workshop included the need for data visualization and its importance in finding problematic data, the effects of data filtering choices on downstream population genomic analyses, the increasing availability of whole-genome sequencing, and the new challenges it presents. Our goal here is to help motivate and educate a worldwide audience to improve population genomic data analysis and interpretation, and thereby advance the contribution of genomics to molecular ecology, evolutionary biology, and especially to the conservation of biodiversity.

AB Twitter-based chat groups (tweetchats) structured as virtual journal clubs have been demonstrated to provide value to learners. In order to promote topics in medical toxicology, we developed the #firesidetox tweetchat as a virtual journal club to discuss and disseminate topics in medical toxicology.
   A group of medical toxicologists from the American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) Public Affairs Committee and editorial board of the Journal of Medical Toxicology (JMT) developed a quarterly one hour tweetchat featuring JMT manuscripts. We gathered basic twittergraphics and used a healthcare hashtag aggregator to measure the number of impressions, participants, and tweets per tweetchat session. A qualitative analysis of important themes from #firesidetox was also completed.
   During five tweetchats over 12 months, we attracted a mean of 23 participants generating a mean of 150 tweets per #firesidetox tweetchat. Tweets generated a mean of 329,200 impressions (unique user views): these impressions grew by 300% from the first through fifth #firesidetox. The majority of participants self-identified as medical toxicologists or physician learners. Although most were from the USA, participants also came from Australia, Poland, and Qatar. Most tweets centered on medical education and 7.9% tweets were learner-driven or questions asking for a medical toxicologist expert opinion.
   The #firesidetox attracted a diverse group of toxicologists, learners, and members of the public in a virtual journal club setting. The increasing number of impressions, participants, and tweets during #firesidetox demonstrates the tweetchat model to discuss pertinent toxicology topics is feasible and well received among its participants.

AB Mental health disorders (MHD) in elite athletes is a topic that has received increased attention in recent years. The overall aim of this position statement is to enhance awareness of this important topic and to critically discuss optimal service provision for athletes who suffer from MHD. In the first part of the paper a short overview of the research on MHD in elite athletes is provided. Elite athletes seem to have comparable prevalence rates for the most common MHD when compared to non-athletic peers, but there are still many disorders that have not been investigated in athletes. Sport specific situations such as injuries, periods of overtraining and career termination may put athletes at an increased risk of developing MHD. In the second part of the paper, models of service provision for elite athletes suffering from MHD from six European countries are presented, focusing on 1) professional service providers, 2) support systems, 3) diagnostic assessment, 4) clinical treatment, 5) performance during treatment, 6) screening, and 7) education systems. It emerges that competencies, certification issues, and professional boundaries of the involved service providers, as well as the structure of the National Health Care systems differ strongly across European countries, which makes defining a golden standard difficult. In the third part of this paper, the authors provide general recommendations for athletes and coaches, clubs, federations, organizations and scholars that hopefully will inspire stakeholders to optimize their support systems.

AB Phytolith study is a new branch of micropaleontology with an increasingly important role in geology, archaeology, and plant taxonomy. Phytoliths have several advantages considering their characteristics of small particle size, high production, wide distribution, anti-decomposition, in situ deposition, distinctive morphologies, and element sequestrating capacity. Phytolith assemblages in modern soil have been found to be closely related to modern vegetation types and climate conditions, which forms the basis for the quantitative study of paleoecology, paleoclimate, and bio-geochemical cycles. At present, phytolith studies generally focus on the following four aspects: (1) Morphology: about 260 unduplicated types of phytoliths have been identified in modern soil, of which 110 types are from grasses, 50 types from ferns, woody plants and other angiosperms, whereas the origin plants of the remaining 100 types are still under investigation. (2) Soil phytolith assemblages and vegetation: phytolith assemblages from the topsoil have been used to distinguish surface vegetation types including different forests and grasslands over a typical region. This model has been applied to restore past vegetation conditions and monitor the dynamic evolution of specific vegetation types at different temporal and spatial scales. (3) Soil phytolith assemblages and climate: quantitative and semi-quantitative relationships between phytolith assemblages and a series of climate parameters, such as annual mean temperature, annual mean precipitation and altitude, have been established through mathematical analysis. In this manner, quantitative reconstruction of paleoclimatic parameters has been achieved through the phytolith-climate transfer function model. (4) Soil phytolith and its sequestered elements: in this topic, the content of soil PhytOC (Phytolith-occluded Organic Carbon) and the importance of PhytOC in the bio-geochemical cycle have been the focus. The study of modern soil phytoliths has provided new approaches and many successful cases for solving specific problems in various fields, such as Earth science and archaeology. This study analyzed existing issues in addition to the abovementioned significant progresses, and provides directions for future research on modern soil phytoliths.

This paper proposes a hot-topic recommendation system based on analysis of the tweets posted by the user, his/her chat partners, and similar users of his/her chat partners, as well as hashtags trending in Twitter. In experiments, the proposed system, which is based on the well-known Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm, was shown to outperform existing recommendation systems with regard to computational efficiency as well as prediction accuracy.

AB Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS - a.k.a. drones) have evolved over the past decade as both advanced military technology and off-the-shelf consumer devices. There is a gradual shift towards public use of drones, which presents opportunities for effective remote procedures that can disrupt a variety of built environment disciplines. UAS equipment with remote sensing gear present an opportunity for analysis and inspection of existing building stocks, where architects, engineers, building energy auditors as well as owners can document building performance, visualize heat transfer using infrared imaging and create digital models using 3D photogrammetry. This paper presents a comprehensive review of various literature that addresses this topic, followed by the identification of a standard procedures for operating a UAS for energy audit missions. The presented framework is then tested on the Syracuse University campus site based on the literature review to showcase: 1) pre-flight inspection procedure parameters and methodologies; 2) during-flight visually identified areas of thermal anomalies using a UAS equipped with Infrared (IR) cameras and; 3) 3D CAD modeling developed through data gathered using UAS. A discussion of the findings suggests refining procedure accuracy through further empirical experimentation, as well as study replication, as a step towards standardizing the automation of building envelope inspection.

AB The topic of uncertainty is of growing interest in the impact assessment (IA) field, due to increases in contextual uncertainty and the awareness of the complexity of advanced analysis. IA practitioners can now draw on maturing theoretical frameworks to manage uncertainty, but questions remain about whether these frameworks align with stakeholder concerns and how their use can benefit IA projects. This article reports on an empirical application of the leading framework for organizing IA uncertainty proposed by Walker et al. in 2003. Twenty-two stakeholders involved in a large water quality modeling project in the U.S. Great Lakes region were interviewed, and their uncertainty-related statements were categorized according to the Walker dimensions. Overall, the frameworks three primary dimensions performed well and allowed for the analysis of differences in uncertainty perceptions among the stakeholder groups. In addition, the analysis resulted in useful insights for the project, such as identifying top scenario uncertainties to use for modeling as well as highlighting specific concerns about the assumptions, data, and modeling approach for further exploration. In addition to encompassing the variety of uncertainty concerns raised in the case, the paper illustrates how the Walker framework can support IA practices like stakeholder collaboration and scenario construction which may improve IA outcomes.

AB The past decade has seen an explosion in the amount of digital information stored in electronic health records (EHRs). While primarily designed for archiving patient information and performing administrative healthcare tasks like billing, many researchers have found secondary use of these records for various clinical informatics applications. Over the same period, the machine learning community has seen widespread advances in the field of deep learning. In this review, we survey the current research on applying deep learning to clinical tasks based on EHR data, where we find a variety of deep learning techniques and frameworks being applied to several types of clinical applications including information extraction, representation learning, outcome prediction, phenotyping, and deidentification. We identify several limitations of current research involving topics such as model interpretability, data heterogeneity, and lack of universal benchmarks. We conclude by summarizing the state of the field and identifying avenues of future deep EHR research.

AB Context. Physician aid in dying is a controversial topic in the U.S., and legislation exists in some states. Personality traits are associated with preferences for end-of-life care and also tend to cluster systematically across states and other geographic regions. Such clustering of personality traits could relate to legislation including physician aid in dying.
   Objective. To determine whether average levels of personality traits in each U.S. state differ between states with and without physician aid in dying legislation.
   Methods. This secondary analysis of national surveys included data on state demographics, political leanings, and state-level averages of Five-Factor Model personality traits. Wilcoxon tests and logistic regression tests were used to assess whether state-level averages in personality traits differed across states with and without physician aid in dying legislation.
   Results. States with physician aid in dying legislation had significantly higher average levels of the trait of openness and significantly lower average levels of the trait of neuroticism. The association with openness was no longer significant after accounting for state conservative advantage.
   Conclusion. The social dialogue and potential controversy surrounding physician aid in dying may be linked to aggregate differences in state personality profiles. States with physician aid in dying legislation tend to be areas where constituents are on average more open minded and experience greater emotional stability. More work is needed to ascertain whether the experiences of receiving and providing end-of-life care may differ across these regions, particularly in relation to conversations around physician aid in dying.

AB Knowledge management (KM) is important to the knowledge-intensive construction industry. The diversified and changing nature of works in this field warrants us to stocktake, identify changes, and map out KM research framework for future exploration. The study involves three aspects. First, three stages of KM research in construction were distinguished in terms of the time distribution of 217 target publications. Major topics in the stages were extracted for understanding the changes of research emphasis from evolutionary perspective. Second, the past works were summed up in a three-dimensional research framework in terms of management organization, managerial methodology and approach, and managerial objective. Finally, potential research orientations in the future were predicted to expand the existing research framework. It was found that (1) KM research has significantly blossomed in the last two decades with a great potential; (2) major topics of KM were changing in terms of technology, technique, organization, attribute of knowledge, and research objectives; (3) past KM studies centred around management organization, managerial methodology and approach, and managerial objective, thus a three-dimensional research framework was proposed; (4) within the research framework, team-level, project-level, and firm-level KM were studied to achieve project, organizational, and competitive objectives by integrated methodologies of information technology, social technique, and KM process tool; and (5) nine potential research orientations were predicted corresponding to the three dimensions. Finally, an expanded research framework was proposed to encourage and guide future research works in this field. The paper only focused on the construction industry. The findings need further exploration in order to discover any possible missing important research works which were not published in English or not included in the time period. The paper formed a systematic framework of KM research in construction and predicted the potential research orientations. It provides much value for the researchers who want to understand the past and the future of global KM research in the construction industry.

AB Multi-object tracking (MOT) is one popular topic in computer vision. It remains a challenging problem in complex scenes, especially of objects with similar appearance. In this case, many existing data association strategies, which link detections among consecutive frames according appearance and motion cues, may fail to track due to unreliable detections or confused appearance and motion. To solve this problem, this paper proposed a novel online multi-object tracking method with detection reliability prior constraint. Our method integrates the trajectory estimation and detection-prediction association into a unified framework. The detection reliability prior constraint is built with the Hankel matrix from object motion model. When we build the Hankel matrix, we adaptively select a set of previous frames to predict object states and calculate the associated weights between detections and candidate objects. Data association in MOT then is estimated by maximum a posteriori (MAP) in a Bayesian framework, accompanied with both previous trajectory and the current detection reliability. Experimental results using synthetic dataset and four public challenging datasets demonstrate that, the proposed method has a good tracking performance compared with the state-of-the-art multi-object trackers.

AB In this paper, we pay attention to reveal the event topics and track the evolutionary trend of social event and a novel probabilistic topic model is proposed. The Multi-modal Multi-layered Topic Classification Model (tm_MMC) for Social Event Analysis has the capacity for revealing visual and non-visual topics, by jointly modeling the textual and visual information while simultaneously learning and predicting the multi-layered category labels. In order to track the evolutionary trends of the topics online, tm_MMC uses topic intensity and heritability to incrementally build an up-to-date model. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we experiment using a collected data, and compare the results with those of other traditional models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our model against several state-of-the-art methods.

AB The use of Phase Change Materials (PCM) in different building applications is a hot topic in today's R&D activities. Numerical simulations of PCM-based components are often used both for research activities and as a design tool, although present-day codes for building performance simulation (BPS) present some shortcomings that limit their reliability. One of these limitations is the limited possibility of replicating the effects given by thermal hysteresis-a characteristic of several PCMs.
   In this paper, an original algorithm that allows hysteresis effects to be accounted for is described and the results from simulations are compared against experimental data. The algorithm is implemented in EnergyPlusTM and makes use of the Energy Management System (EMS) group, one of the high-level control methods available in EnergyPlusTM. The algorithm enables the replication of PCM's different heating/cooling enthalpy curves in this BPS tool, which just recently was equipped with an integrated module for the replication of the effects of thermal hysteresis.
   A comparison between numerical results from the proposed model and from other methods implemented in BPS tools, and the experimental data provided, shows the impact of the algorithm in the simulation of heat transfer in a PCM layer intent for opaque walls. In general, it is shown that the proposed method presents a better agreement with experimental data than alternative modelling approaches, but it is also seen that all the tested numerical models are not fully able to replicating the behaviour of PCM layers if the PCM does not melt or resolidify completely (i.e. it remains in the phase change) during the charge/discharge cycle. A local sensitivity analysis complements this study and highlights the most relevant parameters that influence the results of a simulation carried out with the proposed model.
   Finally, the paper hypothesises that the general discrepancy between simulations and experimental data seen in the case of incomplete melting of the PCM layer can be due to unsuitable data for the thermophysical behaviour of the PCM, which are obtained through conventional characterisation procedures far from the physics of the PCM layer when in real building structures.

AB Sharing bike service is a new emerging public transportation, which has been the hottest topic for months. Sharing bike service provides flexible demand-oriented transit services for city commuters. However, as large amount of sharing bikes flood into big cities, problems caused by chaotic order of sharing bikes are emerging slowly. The authors aim to draw support from taxi trajectories to analyse current traffic condition and improve it with sharing bikes. In this study, the authors propose a traffic congestion finding framework, called CF. In CF, derived from the points density-based clustering method of inspiration, the authors propose a new clustering method (CF-Dbscan) and successfully applied it to the clustering of trajectories. A road network matching algorithm (CF-Matching) helps to match GPS points to road net even if points are in low-sampling-rate. They also employ a ranking feedback mathematical model to adjust the number of sharing bikes of different stations to meet people's demand and reduce redundancy. The first experiment proves that the proposed clustering algorithm performs better than traditional DBSCAN. Another experiment is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework in reducing traffic congestion. The experimental results prove that with the proposed framework the authors can achieve the purpose of easing traffic congestion.

AB Modelling languages have proved to be an effective tool to specify and analyse various perspectives of enterprises and information systems. In addition to modelling language designs, works on model quality and modelling language quality evaluation have contributed to the maturity of the model-driven engineering (MDE) field. Although consolidated knowledge on quality evaluation is still relevant to this scenario, in previous works, we have identified misalignments between the topics that academia is addressing and the needs of industry in applying MDE, thus identifying some remaining challenges. In this paper, we focus on the need for a method to evaluate the quality of a set of modelling languages used in combination within a MDE environment. This paper presents MMQEF (Multiple Modelling language Quality Evaluation Framework), describing its foundations, presenting its method components and discussing its trade-offs.

AB Last years, we have seen an emergence of wide methods in visual object tracking topic as convolutional neural network combined with correlation filter such as hierarchical features (HCF) (Ma et al. 20). However, upon the fact that some features may cause the tracking failures, the existing methods are still suffering of handling complex object appearance changes such as fast motion, significant deformation and occlusions. Further, they learn the correlation filter in frequency domain using Fourier transform, which cause unwanted boundary effects, which severely degrade the quality of the tracking model. Moreover, these methods are incapable of dealing with the illumination variation because they rely only on RGB base for color sequences. In this paper, we propose a novel method, which addresses the pre-cited problems. As first contribution, we learn adaptively three correlation filters in the spatial domain, with hierarchical convolutional features extracted from specific layers. Indeed, we apply the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to solve the update model equation of the correlation filters. Second, we propose that the switching between RGB and HSV color bases, give a soft manner to handle the illumination variation. For this aim, an HSV-energy condition is presented to choose the appropriate color base resorting to the energy of the second HSV component. Extensive experiments on a common benchmark dataset, justify that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-art methods.

AB Community discovery is a leading research topic in social network analysis. In this paper, we present an ego-network probabilistic graphical model (ENPGM) which encodes users' feature similarities and the causal dependencies between users' profiles, communities, and ego networks. The model comprises three parts: a profile similarity probabilistic graph, social circle vector, and relationship probabilistic vector. Using Bayesian networks, the profile similarity probabilistic graph considers information about both the features of individuals and network structures with low memory usage. The social circle vector is proposed to describe both the alters belonging to a community and the features causing the community to emerge. The relationship probabilistic vector represents the probability that an ego network forms when given a set of user profiles and a set of circles. We then propose a parameter-learning algorithm and the ego-network probabilistic criterion (ENPC) for extracting communities from ego networks with some missing feature values. The ENPC score balances both the positive and negative impacts of social circles on the probabilities of forming an ego network. Experimental results using Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ datasets indicate that the ENPGM and community learning algorithms can predict social circles with similar quality to the ground-truth communities.

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate the investment threshold of carbon capture and storage (CCS) project from the perspective of supply chain, overcoming the limitations of previous works regarding this topic mainly from a single investor's perspective. An analytical real options model was firstly presented for the scenario of centralized decision making, then the model was extended by integrating the real options theory with the game theory to examine the CCS investment threshold for the scenario of dual-echelon supply chain. An interesting finding is that CCS investment requires a much higher threshold under the dual-echelon supply chain than that under the centralized scenario, and this finding is consolidated by a numerical example simulation. Furthermore, the results of the numerical simulation indicated that the CCS investment threshold is positively affected by carbon price volatility, CO2 capture rate and the transfer payments coefficients, while negatively affected by capital subsidy. These conclusions can provide theoretical foundation for decision-making of CCS investment and related policy-making.

AB Inventory control and pricing are two of the most important topics of business and academic researches. In this paper, an optimal control approach is taken to fmd optimal dynamic prices and replenishment cycle simultaneously with the aim of maximizing the total profit of a non-instantaneous deteriorating item. The deterioration rate is not considered fixed, but rather increases after some time. Furthermore an expiration date is considered at which time any unsold inventory becomes worthless and should be discarded. Customer demand depends on selling price and displayed inventory level. We address the problem at two steps. First assuming that the replenishment cycle is given, the optimal dynamic pricing is obtained by using Pontryagin's maximum principle. Then, a one-dimensional algorithm is designed to obtain the joint optimal solution. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the theoretical results, perform the sensitivity analysis, and provide real life interpretations. Finally, the paper is concluded and directions for future research are highlighted.

AB The performance of supply chain systems directly depends on the design of distribution networks. On the other hand, uncertainty is one of important and challenging subjects in distribution networks. Another real supposition is that the decisions in a distribution network are usually adopted in a hierarchical manner. By adopting these topics and contrary to previous works, this study firstly develops a two-stage stochastic bi-level decision-making model to simulate the behavior of a distribution network, more efficiently. Generally, the proposed problem is based on the static Stackelberg game between the Distribution Centers (DCs) in the upper-level and Customer Zones (CZs) in the lower-level of the model. Due to the uncertainty of the proposed problem, a financial risk model has been considered as well. The literature reveals that the most of different exact methods are not recommended to solve the bi-level models for large-scale problems. Another contribution of this study is to propose a set of quick heuristics along with two new hybrid metaheuristics based on the benefits of recent and traditional algorithms to solve the developed model in large-scale networks. In order to check the quality of algorithms' results, an explicit enumeration algorithm structured by E-constraint method is considered in small sizes. A comparative study reveals that although the proposed heuristics reach the optimal solution in less time, the solution quality of hybrid metaheuristics is strongly better than others. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed model is validated by a set of sensitivity analyses through a real industrial example.

AB Scientific literature is currently the most important resource for scholars, and their citations have provided researchers with a powerful latent way to analyze scientific trends, influences and relationships of works and authors. This paper is focused on automatic citation analysis and summarization for the scientific literature of computational linguistics, which are also the shared tasks in the 2016 workshop of the 2nd Computational Linguistics Scientific Document Summarization at BIRNDL 2016 (The Joint Workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing for Digital Libraries). Each citation linkage between a citation and the spans of text in the reference paper is recognized according to their content similarities via various computational methods. Then the cited text span is classified to five pre-defined facets, i.e., Hypothesis, Implication, Aim, Results and Method, based on various features of lexicons and rules via Support Vector Machine and Voting Method. Finally, a summary of the reference paper from the cited text spans is generated within 250 words. hLDA (hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic model is adopted for content modeling, which provides knowledge about sentence clustering (subtopic) and word distributions (abstractiveness) for summarization. We combine hLDA knowledge with several other classical features using different weights and proportions to evaluate the sentences in the reference paper. Our systems have been ranked top one and top two according to the evaluation results published by BIRNDL 2016, which has verified the effectiveness of our methods.

ID INFORMATION-SEEKING BEHAVIOR
AB When scientists are searching for information, they generally have a precise objective in mind. Instead of looking for documents "about a topic T", they try to answer specific questions such as finding the definition of a concept, finding results for a particular problem, checking whether an idea has already been tested, or comparing the scientific conclusions of two articles. Answering these precise or complex queries on a corpus of scientific documents requires precise modelling of the full content of the documents. In particular, each document element must be characterised by its discourse type (hypothesis, definition, result, method, etc.). In this paper, we present a scientific document model (SciAnnotDoc ontology), developed from an empirical study conducted with scientists, that models the discourse types. We developed an automated process that analyses documents effectively identifying the discourse types of each element. Using syntactic rules (patterns), we evaluated the process output in terms of precision and recall using a previously annotated corpus in Gender Studies. We chose to annotate documents in Humanities, as these documents are well known to be less formalised than those in "hard science". The process output has been used to create a SciAnnotDoc representation of the corpus on top of which we built a faceted search interface. Experiments with users show that searches using with this interface clearly outperform standard keyword searches for precise or complex queries.

DT Article
DE Motorcycle; stability; chatter; driveline; slip stiffness
AB Experimental evidence shows that a self-excited vibration may appear during braking manoeuvres performed by road-racing motorcycles. It involves vertical oscillation of front and rear wheel axles as well as angular oscillation of the driveline in a frequency range between 17 and 22Hz. As a consequence, severe oscillations of the tyre-ground vertical loads can be observed, leading to a loss of grip and ultimately weakening the vehicle overall performance. Several contributions on this topic can be accounted for in the literature; however, a comprehensive description of the phenomenon has not been given yet. The present work is aimed at simulating the above vibration with a planar multibody motorcycle model, and then at analyzing its driving mechanism. Stability maps are drawn for time-invariant braking manoeuvres, and validated with respect to time domain simulations.

AB We commonly refer to state estimation theory in geosciences as data assimilation (DA). This term encompasses the entire sequence of operations that, starting from the observations of a system, and from additional statistical and dynamical information (such as a dynamical evolution model), provides an estimate of its state. DA is standard practice in numerical weather prediction, but its application is becoming widespread in many other areas of climate, atmosphere, ocean, and environment modeling; in all circumstances where one intends to estimate the state of a large dynamical system based on limited information. While the complexity of DA, and of the methods thereof, stands on its interdisciplinary nature across statistics, dynamical systems, and numerical optimization, when applied to geosciences, an additional difficulty arises by the continually increasing sophistication of the environmental models. Thus, in spite of DA being nowadays ubiquitous in geosciences, it has so far remained a topic mostly reserved to experts. We aim this overview article at geoscientists with a background in mathematical and physical modeling, who are interested in the rapid development of DA and its growing domains of application in environmental science, but so far have not delved into its conceptual and methodological complexities.

AB Background and Objective: Congenital anomalies are seen at 1-3% of the population, probabilities of which are tried to be found out primarily through double, triple and quad tests during pregnancy. Also, ultra-sonographical evaluations of fetuses enhance detecting and defining these abnormalities. About 60-70% of the anomalies can be diagnosed via ultra-sonography, while the remaining 30-40% can be diagnosed after childbirth. Medical diagnosis and prediction is a topic that is closely related with e-Health and machine learning. e-Health applications are critically important especially for the patients unable to see a doctor or any health professional. Our objective is to help clinicians and families to better predict fetal congenital anomalies besides the traditional pregnancy tests using machine learning techniques and e-Health applications.
   Methods: In this work, we developed a prediction system with assistive e-Health applications which both the pregnant women and practitioners can make use of. A performance comparison (considering Accuracy, Fl-Score, AUC measures) was made between 9 binary classification models (Averaged Perceptron, Boosted Decision Tree, Bayes Point Machine, Decision Forest, Decision Jungle, Locally-Deep Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, Support Vector Machine) which were trained with the clinical dataset of 96 pregnant women and used to process data to predict fetal anomaly status based on the maternal and clinical data. The dataset was obtained through maternal questionnaire and detailed evaluations of 3 clinicians from RadyoEmar radiodiagnostics center in Istanbul, Turkey. Our e-Health applications are used to get pregnant women's health status and clinical history parameters as inputs, recommend them physical activities to perform during pregnancy, and inform the practitioners and finally the patients about possible risks of fetal anomalies as the output.
   Results: In this paper, the highest accuracy of prediction was displayed as 89.5% during the development tests with Decision Forest model. In real life testing with 16 users, the performance was 87.5%. This estimate is sufficient to give an idea of fetal health before the patient visits the physician.
   Conclusions: The proposed work aims to provide assistive services to pregnant women and clinicians via an online system consisting of a mobile side for the patients, a web application side for their clinicians and a prediction system. In addition, we showed the impact of certain clinical data parameters of pregnant on the fetal health status, statistically correlated the parameters with the existence of fetal anomalies and showed guidelines for future researches.

AB Objective: Our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of sepsis has attained exponential growth. Yet, the pillars of its care remain antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and physiologic support of failing organ systems. The inability to bring biologic breakthroughs to the bedside is not for lack of effort. Over 60 clinical trials of novel therapies, each heavily supported by the momentum of biologic data suggesting clinical utility, have been conducted and have failed to identify benefit. This mass of negative clinical data abut an equally towering mound of knowledge of sepsis biology, which collectively have led investigators to ask, what happened?
   Data Sources: Review of published scientific literature via MEDLINE searches using key terms related to the article topics.
   Study Selection: Original articles, review articles, and systematic reviews were considered.
   Data Extraction: Articles were selected for inclusion based upon author consensus.
   Data Synthesis: Here, we present a synthetic review of some of the challenges in translating experimental animal models of sepsis to the bedside. We commence with the concept that the heterogeneity in the kinetics of the sepsis response serves as an important, often underappreciated but surmountable, source of translational impedance. Upon this groundwork, we discuss distinctions between animal experimentation and clinical trial design in the elements for hypothesis testing: cohort selection, power and sample size, randomization and blinding, and timing of intervention. From this concept, we develop a contextual framework for advancing the paradigm of animal-based investigations to facilitate science that transitions from molecule to medicine.
   Conclusions: A persistent divide exists between the laboratory and clinical research arenas, which may be addressable via systematic targeting of identified translational gaps.

AB An important topic in multivariate extreme-value theory is to develop probabilistic models and statistical methods to describe and measure the strength of dependence among extreme observations. The theory is well established for data whose dependence structure is compatible with that of asymptotically dependent models. On the contrary, in many applications data do not comply with asymptotically dependent models and thus new tools are required. This article contributes to the methodological development of such a context, by considering a component-wise maxima approach. First we propose a statistical test based on the classical Pickands dependence function to verify whether asymptotic dependence or independence holds. Then, we present a new Pickands dependence function to describe the extremal dependence under asymptotic independence. Finally, we propose an estimator of the latter, we establish its main asymptotic properties and we illustrate its performance by a simulation study. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The exponential amplification of initial seed magnetic fields in relativistic plasmas is a very important topic in astrophysics, from the conditions in the early Universe to the interior of neutron stars. While dynamo action in a turbulent plasma is often invoked, in the last years a novel mechanism of quantum origin has gained increasingly more attention, namely the chiral magnetic effect (CME), This has been recognized in semi-metals, and it is most likely at work in the quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy-ion collision experiments, where the highest magnetic fields in nature, up to B similar to 10(18) G, are produced. This effect is expected to survive even at large hydrodynamical/magnelohydrodynamic (MHD) scales, and it is based on the chiral anomaly due to an imbalance between left- and right-handed relativistic fermions in the constituent plasma. Such imbalance leads to an electric current parallel to an external magnetic field, which is precisely the same mechanism of an alpha-dynamo action in classical MHD. Here, we extend the close parallelism between the chiral and the dynamo effects to relativistic plasmas, and we propose a unified, fully covariant formulation of the generalized Ohm's law. Moreover, we derive for the first time the 3 + 1 general relativistic MHD equations for a chiral plasma both in flat and curved space-times, in view of numerical investigation of the CME in compact objects, especially magnetars, or of the interplay among the non-ideal magnetic effects of dynamo, the CME and reconnection.

AB We measure the projected galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing signals using the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) to study galaxy bias. We use the concept of non-linear and stochastic galaxy biasing in the framework of halo occupation statistics to constrain the parameters of the halo occupation statistics and to unveil the origin of galaxy biasing. The bias function Gamma(gm)(r(p)), where r(p) is the projected comoving separation, is evaluated using the analytical halo model from which the scale dependence of Gamma(gm)(r(p)), and the origin of the non-linearity and stochasticity in halo occupation models can be inferred. Our observations unveil the physical reason for the non-linearity and stochasticity, further explored using hydrodynamical simulations, with the stochasticity mostly originating from the non-Poissonian behaviour of satellite galaxies in the dark matter haloes and their spatial distribution, which does not follow the spatial distribution of dark matter in the halo. The observed non-linearity is mostly due to the presence of the central galaxies, as was noted from previous theoretical work on the same topic. We also see that overall, more massive galaxies reveal a stronger scale dependence, and out to a larger radius. Our results show that a wealth of information about galaxy bias is hidden in halo occupation models, These models should therefore he used to determine the influence of galaxy bias in cosmological studies.

AB Damages of the (agro)ecosystem by extensive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, the global dying of bee populations possibly linked to pesticide spraying, and stricter regulations for pesticide use together with successful use of microbials in IPM programs are pushing on the development and commercialization of new microbial products and a large and growing biostimulants and biocontrol market. This review focuses on microbial inoculants including bacteria, fungi, and viruses used as biostimulant or biocontrol agent for foliar application and covers all important steps from inoculant development to successful field application. Topics presented comprise typical spraying equipment including the importance of the spraying process and relating effects, furthermore formulation development including classification and adjuvants, and thirdly regulatory aspects as currently applied or under discussion. Microbial inoculants for foliar spray reported in scientific literature are summarized and contrasted with selected commercial products. Special attention is given to factors most important in microbial spray: (a) type of active ingredient (bacteria, fungi, viruses), (b) mode of action (ingestion, contact, competition), (c) interaction with the plant leaf surface, (d) droplet size in terms of microbe concentration and leaf coverage, and (e) environmental conditions during spraying. Finally, we want to emphasize that timely administration is of utmost importance for successful spraying and maximum efficacy. This might be supported by weather stations and disease/pest models as an important step towards precision farming.

ID FEATURE-EXTRACTION; OUTLIER DETECTION
AB Chinese materia medica resource survey provides an important basis for the development of traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) industry. During the Chinese materia medica resource survey process, millions of materia medica plant images are collected. The collected image dataset includes some images that are unqualified for image analysis, i.e. they can't be used to build medicinal plant classifier model. It is a burdensome work to identify the unqualified Chinese materia medica resource images manually. How to screen the unqualified images automatically is an important task of Chinese materia medica resource survey. Image recognition techniques developed quickly in recent years. Outlier detection is a kind of unsupervised method to find the unqualified images automatically. Lots of research work has been done on the topic. Extracted features and correlation metric play important roles on the outlier image detection result. For improving the image screening performance, a novel outlier detection method is proposed in this paper. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract the complicated features of Chinese materia medica resource images. Extended entropy is introduced into the calculation of information loss that is used to measure the distance between images. Based on the extracted image features and correlation metric, a novel outlier detection method based on clustering is proposed here. The efficiency of the screening method is illustrated with a practical example.

AB Nonlinear electric devices are important and essential for setting circuits so that chaotic outputs or periodical series can be generated. Chaotic circuits can be mapped into dimensionless dynamical systems by using scale transformation, and thus, synchronization control can be further investigated in numerical way. In case of synchronization approach, resistor is often used to bridge two chaotic circuits and gap junction connection is used to realize possible synchronization. In fact, complex electromagnetic effect in circuits should be considered when the capacitor and inductor (inductance coil) are attacked by high-frequency signals or noise-like disturbance. In this paper, two chaotic circuits are connected by using voltage coupling (via resistor) and triggering mutual induction electromotive force, which time-varying magnetic field is generated in the inductance coils. Therefore, magnetic field coupling is realized between two isolate inductance coils and induction electromotive force is generated to adjust the oscillation in circuits. It is found that field coupling can modulate the synchronization behaviors of chaotic circuits. In case of periodical oscillating state, the synchronization between two periodical circuits under voltage coupling is destroyed when field coupling is considered. Furthermore, the synchronization between chaotic circuits becomes more difficult when field coupling is triggered. Open problems for this topic are proposed for further investigation.

AB Wind and fire phenomena can together be a devastating force, whether in the case of a building fire, release of smoke in an urban area or forest fire near an urban habitat. Most of the fire phenomena are influenced by the wind, usually for the worse. If we want to understand fires, we have to understand wind as well, and model it appropriately. This modelling is described by the discipline of Computational Wind Engineering, from which we are able to transfer invaluable knowledge to coupled wind-fire analyses. This two-part review is dedicated to such a transfer. In Part I, the authors describe the historical and most current instances of wind and fire coupled modelling, referred to as simple models, in situ measurements, wind tunnel experiments or numerical studies with CFD. The review is subdivided into six categories, namely flame behaviour in wind conditions, indoor flows, natural smoke ventilators, tunnel ventilation, wildfires and firebrand transport, and urban dispersion of smoke. Besides flame behaviour, all remaining topics are covered, to the best of the authors' knowledge, with multiple references to valuable experimental and numerical studies. In Part II of the review, the authors describe the best practices of Computational Wind Engineering, that may be transferred to fire-oriented numerical studies. This part provides good practice guidelines, reference studies and a proposal for the optimisation of the simulation procedure for coupled wind and fire models.

AB Background and AimThe effects of text cohesion and added pictures on acquired knowledge have been heavily studied each in isolation. Furthermore, studies on the effects of specific characteristics of pictures, whether facilitating or hindering, are scarce. Schnotz's ITCP Model (2014) allows to formulate hypotheses regarding the combined effect of text cohesion and presence and level of detail of a picture. This study investigates these hypotheses in the case of children reading scientific texts.
   SampleOne hundred and one-second-, third-, and fourth-grade pupils with a mean age of 9years, in the western United States.
   MethodsData were collected over three sessions to encompass an understanding of each pupil's knowledge based on prior sessions.
   Results and ConclusionsResults showed a significant increase in pupils' knowledge between pre-test and immediate post-test, but as hypothesized, no significant difference between levels of cohesion. No significant difference between types of pictures was detected. After 1week, knowledge built with a high cohesive text significantly dropped with low-detail picture, whereas, with high detail, or no picture, there was no significant difference. Results suggested that when participants were given a low-detail picture with a low cohesive text, the integration process of the material was more restricted than with a high cohesive text.

AB In this article, we use topic modeling to systematically explore topics discussed in contemporary art criticism. Analyzing 6965 articles published between 1991 and 2015 in Frieze, a leading art magazine, we find a plurality of topics characterizing professional discourse on contemporary art. Not surprisingly, media- or genre-specific topics such as film/cinema, photography, sculpture/installations, etc. emerge. Interestingly, extra-artistic topics also characterize contemporary art criticism: there is room for articles on new digital technology and on art and philosophy; there is also growing interest in the relationship between art and society. Our analysis shows that despite evolutions in the field of contemporary art - such as the social turn', in which contemporary art starts paying more attention to social forms and content - the prevalence of certain topics in contemporary art criticism has barely changed over the past 25 years. With this article, we demonstrate the unique value of topic modeling for cultural sociology: it is both a powerful computational technique to generate a bird's-eye view of a huge text corpus and a heuristic device that locates key texts for further close reading.

AB PurposeThe current experiment examined the use of a model statement for aiding lie detection and gathering additional information during interviews in which pairs of suspects were interviewed together (i.e., collective interviewing). A model statement is an example of an answer, unrelated to the topic under investigation, which is played to suspects to demonstrate how much information the interviewer wants them to provide in response to the question asked.
   MethodPairs of truth-tellers visited a restaurant together, whereas pairs of liars completed a mock crime. The task for all pairs was to convince an interviewer that they were visiting a restaurant together at the time the crime was committed. Half the truth-telling pairs and half the lying pairs were exposed to a model statement, whilst the other halves were not.
   ResultsTruth-telling pairs were more detailed and showed more interactions than lying pairs, particularly in the model statement present condition.
   ConclusionsBeing exposed to a model statement in a collective interview magnified the differences between pairs of truth-tellers and pairs of liars in reporting detail and interacting with one another. A model statement is simple to implement and can be applied to many real-world investigative interviewing settings whereby the focus is on lie detection and gathering as much information as possible.

AB BackgroundWe examined whether the verbal cue, proportion of complications, was a more diagnostic cue to deceit than the amount of information provided (e.g., total number of details).
   MethodIn the experiment, 53 participants were interviewed. Truth tellers (n=27) discussed a trip they had made during the last twelve months; liars (n=26) fabricated a story about such a trip. The interview consisted of an initial recall followed by a model statement (a detailed account of an experience unrelated to the topic of investigation) followed by a post-model statement recall. The key dependent variables were the amount of information provided and the proportion of all statements that were complications.
   ResultsThe proportion of complications was significantly higher amongst truth tellers than amongst liars, but only in the post-model statement recall. The amount of information provided did not discriminate truth tellers from liars in either the initial or post-model statement recall.
   ConclusionThe proportion of complications is a more diagnostic cue to deceit than the amount of information provided as it takes the differential verbal strategies of truth tellers and liars into account.

AB Detail plant species classification using very high spatial resolution data is a challenging task. Exploring the potential of imagery acquired by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to identify individual species of plants and assessing values of additional inputs such as height and thermal information into classification process are hot research topics. Our study uses a fusion of visible, multispectral and thermal imagery acquired through the low altitude aerial survey for detail classification of land cover and vegetation types. The study area is located in the central part of the Czech Republic and situated in an environmentally specific area - an arboretum of 2.45 ha. Visible (i.e. RGB), multispectral, and thermal sensors were mounted on a flying fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial System. The imagery was acquired at a very detailed scale with Ground Sampling Distance of 3-18 cm. Besides three mosaics (one from each sensor), normalized Digital Surface Models were built from visible and multispectral sensors. Eight classification models were created - each mosaic (visible/multispectral) was enriched with height data, thermal data, and combined height and thermal information. A classification into a three level system was performed through Geographic Object-based Image Analysis using Support Vector Machine algorithm. In general, Overall Accuracy grew with the amount of information entering the classification process. Accuracy reached 77 - 91 % depending on the level of generalization for the best model based on multispectral data and 67 - 80 % for data from the visible sensor. Both thermal data and height information improved the accuracy; however, the statistical evaluation did not reveal any significant difference between the contribution of height and thermal data. Results also indicate that increasing spectral resolution leads to a significantly better performance of the models than higher spatial resolution. UAVs equipped with a proper sensor provide a convenient technology for detail land cover classification even in areas with many similar plant species.

AB Geothermal energy provides an opportunity for sustainable energy supply. Nevertheless, some local geothermal energy projects face public opposition. To understand public acceptance or rejection of technologies, appropriate methods need to be applied depending on the project phase. This is exemplified for geothermal energy, for which an exploratory, qualitative study was conducted which uncovered laypeoples' mental models by assessing picture, word and colour associations on geothermal energy. Participants (N = 79) were asked for their associations on geothermal energy, as well as its general acceptance. The results revealed insights into cognitive conceptions as well as possible misconceptions. It could also be shown that participants' evaluation of associations in terms of positive emotions correlated positively with geothermal energy acceptance. The study verifies that assessing mental models can be valuable in early phases of understanding public acceptance, as acceptance-relevant criteria and topics to be addressed can be identified in order to adequately respond to people's concerns.

AB The topic of this study is one of the most important models of mathematical biology; namely, a nonlinear first order delayed model about the infection of CD+ T-cells by HIV. In this model, the effect of virus on human immune system is described through depletion of healthy CD+ T-cells, where the delayed term representing the eclipse phase of virus makes the model more realistic. To obtain approximate solutions of this model, we develop a method reminiscent of the discrete Galerkin method. Considering the approximate solutions in the form of polynomials, we first substitute these approximate solutions in the original model. Some relations are thus obtained, which we express in terms of matrices. Following Galerkin's path, we take inner product of a set of monomials with these matrix expressions, thus obtaining a nonlinear system of algebraic equations. The solution of this system gives the approximate solutions of the model. Additionally, the technique of residual correction, which aims to reduce the error of the approximate solution by estimating this error, is discussed in some detail. The method and the residual correction technique are illustrated with an example problem.

AB Spanking as a form of punishment continues to be a highly prevalent form of discipline employed by parents in the U.S. to encourage compliance from children. Recent research continues to support that spanking does not lead to positive outcomes for children, and can be potentially detrimental in several different development facets. Bullying and the negative consequences for children and society has recently been an especially popular topic in the literature. Although much has been written and explored about implications of spanking, very few research studies have investigated the link of parental spanking on bullying behavior in young children. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of spanking and the likelihood of bullying behaviors in early childhood. Data for this study were used from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, consisting of 1020 mothers with young children was used collected at 4 different time points (Year 1, Year 3, Year 5, and Year 9). By utilizing structural equation modeling, we developed an autoregressive cross-lagged panel model to longitudinally test the connection between maternal spanking and childhood bullying. Our results indicated that spanking at age 1 positively predicted childhood bullying at age 3 for male children and negatively predicted bullying for females. Numerous autoregressive paths were statistically significant, indicating that maternal spanking at younger ages predicted spanking as the child aged. To gain further understanding our results were separated by the gender of the child. The results of the study have important implications for researchers, educators, and clinicians.

AB The effectiveness of peer leaders in promoting health may depend on the position they occupy within their social networks. Using sociocentric (whole network) and behavioral data from the intervention arm of a cluster-randomized HIV prevention trial in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, we used generalized linear models with standardized predictors to examine the association between heath leaders' baseline structural network position (i.e., in-degree and betweenness centrality) and their 12-month self-reported (1) confidence in educating network members about HIV and gender-based violence (GBV) and (2) number of past-week conversations about HIV and GBV. As in-degree centrality increased, leaders reported fewer HIV-related conversations. As betweenness centrality increased, leaders reported greater number of conversations about GBV. Network position was not significantly associated with confidence in discussing either topic. Our results suggest that peer leaders who occupy spaces between sub-groups of network members may be more effective in engaging their peers in sensitive or controversial topics like GBV than more popular peer leaders.

AB Media data has been the subject of large scale analysis with applications of text mining being used to provide overviews of media themes and information flows. Such information extracted from media articles has also shown its contextual value of being integrated with other data, such as criminal records and stock market pricing. In this work, we explore linking textual media data with curated secondary textual data sources through user-guided semantic lexical matching for identifying relationships and data links. In this manner, critical information can be identified and used to annotate media timelines in order to provide a more detailed overview of events that may be driving media topics and frames. These linked events are further analyzed through an application of causality modeling to model temporal drivers between the data series. Such causal links are then annotated through automatic entity extraction which enables the analyst to explore persons, locations, and organizations that may be pertinent to the media topic of interest. To demonstrate the proposed framework, two media datasets and an armed conflict event dataset are explored.

Rather than being merely considered as an outcome of low-probability/high-impact processes, cascading events can be associated with the cross-scale accumulation of vulnerability paths constituted by events waiting to happen. In this context, instead of focusing solely on triggering events, it seems important to point out the interactions orienting the escalation of secondary emergencies through vulnerability paths.
   This special issue integrates those emerging aspects with an operational approach that considers cascades as the complex, non-linear escalation of secondary emergencies. Key topics addressed by the contributions include: cross-domain modelling of interdependent systems; decision support systems; economic impact assessment of critical events; and cascades in the built environment, in social domains, and in applied emergency management. Our conclusions support the work of academia, and of public and private stakeholders, by providing a comprehensive analysis of the topic for the improvement of theory, the assessment of resilience, the formulation of policies for managing crises, and operational planning for emergencies.

AB Natural dune growth after nourishment is often observed, and such growth plays an important role in beach management for coastal communities. Nourishment sand equilibration after construction is another important topic for project planning and design. Large-scale nourishment projects at Nags Head (NC, USA) (completed in 2011) and Bridgehampton-Sagaponack (NY, USA) (completed in 2014) are under comparatively high-wave energy conditions and offer new insight regarding these topics. After nourishment, a natural beach and inshore morphology were produced with high rates of dune growth by eolian transport. At Nags Head, volumetric dune growth averaged 8 m(3)/m/yr over the first 5 years following project completion, while Bridgehampton-Sagaponack averaged 9 m(3)/m/yr over the first 3 post-project years. Results are compared with the Bagnold (1941) analytical model predictions of dune growth and are shown to correlate and decay closely with dry-sand beach width as the nourished profile equilibrates. The extra volume and elevation in the dunes have provided a higher level of storm protection and have helped the sites avoid any major damage to oceanfront properties during hurricanes or numerous severe winter storms.

AB Despite the prevalence of sexual assault on college campuses, few interventions aimed at decreasing college men's proclivity to perpetrate sexual aggression have been developed and tested. This article details the theoretical framework, content, and piloting of a sexual assault prevention program for college men who engage in heavy drinking, a high-risk group who may be particularly well positioned to intervene as proactive bystanders in drinking environments. In an open trial, male facilitators delivered the three-session Sexual Assault and Alcohol Feedback and Education (SAFE) program to 25 heavy drinking college men. Session 1 was a 90-min review of personalized normative feedback regarding alcohol use, sexual activity, alcohol-related sexual consequences, understanding of consent, and engagement in bystander intervention, delivered individually in a motivational interviewing style. Session 2 was a 21/2-hr group-based sexual assault prevention workshop focusing on social norms, empathy, masculinity, consent, and bystander intervention. Session 3 was a 90-min booster group session that reviewed previous topics and included the active practice of bystander intervention skills. Analyses of postsession assessments of utility, therapeutic alliance, and satisfaction and examination of alcohol use and sexual assault-related outcomes from baseline to the 2-month assessment support the preliminary feasibility and acceptability of the SAFE program.

AB Semantic human activity (SHA) refers to users' activities performed in their daily lives (e.g., having dinner, shopping, etc.). SHA recognition is a promising issue in wearable and mobile computing. Most existing methods represent a SHA based on a single view, e.g., representing a SHA as a combination of human body actions, representing a SHA as a distribution of latent semantics. Since SHAs are complicated in nature, single views lack the ability of comprehensively profiling SHAs. In this paper, we propose a bi-view semi-supervised learning based method for recognizing SHAs using accelerometers. First, we represent a SHA based on two different views. One view represents a SHA as a distribution of latent activities in an unsupervised manner, and the other view represents a SHA as a set of human crafted features extracted in a hierarchical way. Second, we use a semi-supervised learning framework, which exploits the complementary information provided by the two views, to improve the classification accuracy based on both labeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments show that representing SHAs based on bi-views is more effective than representing SHAs based on single views, and our method is able to yield a competitive SHA recognition performance.

AB A macroscope is proposed and tested here for the discovery of the unique argumentative footprint that characterizes how a collective (e.g., group, online community) manages differences and pursues disagreement through argument in a polylogue. The macroscope addresses broader analytic problems posed by various conceptualizations of large-scale argument, such as fields, spheres, communities, and institutions. The design incorporates a two-tier methodology for detecting argument patterns of the arguments performed in arguing by an interactive collective that produces views, or topographies, of the ways that issues are generated in the making and defending of standpoints. The design premises for the macroscope build on insights about argument patterns from pragma-dialectical theory by incorporating research and theory on disagreement management and the Argumentum Model of Topics. The design reconceptualizes prototypical and stereotypical argument patterns for characterizing large-scale argumentation. A prototype of the macroscope is tested on data drawn from six threads about oil-drilling and fracking from the subreddit Changemyview. The implementation suggests the efficacy of the macroscope's design and potential for identifying what communities make controversial and how the disagreement space in a polylogue is managed through stereotypical argument patterns in terms of claims/premises, inferential relations, and presentational devices.

We give efficient estimates of the moments for two models that are well known, e.g., in text mining, the single-topic model and latent Dirichlet allocation, and we provide a tensor decomposition algorithm for the moments that proves to be robust both in theory and in practice. Experiments on synthetic data show that the proposed estimators outperform the existing ones in terms of reconstruction accuracy, and that the proposed tensor decomposition technique achieves the learning accuracy of the state-of-the-art method with significantly smaller running times. We also provide examples of applications to real-world text corpora for both single-topic model and LDA, obtaining meaningful results.

AB Gait analysis is commonly addressed through inverse dynamics. However, forward dynamics can be advantageous when descending to muscular level, as it allows activation and contraction equations to be integrated with motion thus providing better dynamic consistency, or when studying assisted gait, as it enables the estimation of the interaction forces between subject and devices even if the motion capture process doesn't provide enough resolution to distinguish the motions of limb and device. Control-based methods seem to be the most natural choice to carry out the forward-dynamics analysis of an acquired gait, but several options exist in their application. The paper explores such options for healthy and assisted gait, and concludes that the computed torque control of all the subject's degrees of freedom is the alternative that provides the most accurate results. Moreover, the study of its more problematic underactuated variant accompanied by contact models showed to be connected to neighbor challenging topics as gait prediction or walking simulation of humanoids.

DE Dynamics; Workbench
AB There has been considerable focus in the research community on developing accurate models, as well as on fast algorithms for solving the equations of motion of multibody systems required for simulating the dynamics of such systems. This paper focuses on the less explored complementary topic of evaluating system level dynamics properties of multibody systems. Examples of such dynamics properties are the system mass matrix, Jacobians and sensitivities of these quantities. These system level quantities manifest the dynamical properties of the system and are important for design, optimization and control. While such system level quantities are often used in theory to describe the underlying mathematical physics of the systems, due to their complexity there is a lack of a systematic methods for computing them when desired. In this paper we describe a computational workbench framework that provides a bridge between theory and the computation of such system level quantities. This workbench framework builds upon the Spatial Operator Algebra (SOA) that has been used for analysis and algorithm development for multibody dynamics. Mathematical operator expressions from the SOA can be transcribed literally to the workbench command line to allow the easy evaluation of complex dynamics quantities. We use a specific Python/C++ implementation of a workbench called PyCraft to illustrate the structure and use of such a workbench. Several examples illustrating operator-based analysis and corresponding PyCraft-based computation are included.

AB The origin and rapid diversification of angiosperms (flowering plants) represent one of the most intriguing topics in evolutionary biology. Despite considerable progress made in complementary fields over the last two decades (paleobotany, phylogenetics, ecology, evo-devo, genomics), many important questions remain. For instance, what has been the impact of mass extinctions on angiosperm diversification? Are the angiosperms an adaptive radiation? Has morphological evolution in angiosperms been gradual or pulsed? We propose that the recent and ongoing revolution in macroevolutionary methods provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore long-standing questions that probably hold important clues to understand present-day biodiversity. We present six key questions that explore the origin and diversification of angiosperms. We also identify three key challenges to address these questions: (1) the development of new integrative models that include diversification, multiple intrinsic and environmental traits, biogeography and the fossil record all at once, whilst accounting for sampling bias and heterogeneity of macroevolutionary processes through time and among lineages; (2) the need for large and standardized synthetic databases of morphological variation; and (3) continuous effort on sampling the fossil record, but with a revolution in current paleobotanical practice.

AB The task of an accurate determination of alpha-decay rate of Sm-147 isotope, a topic of importance in both basic and applied science, has been performed in the present research following two different routes. First, a critical review and data analysis of the whole set of half-life values obtained till date yielded an average of 106.3 +/- 0.5 Ga. Second, a one-parameter, semi-empirical model for alpha emission from nuclei, developed in the framework of quantum mechanical tunneling mechanism through a Coulomb-plus-centrifugal-plus-overlapping potential barrier, that yielded a value of 108.2 +/- 3.0 Ga. The good agreement found between the half-life values obtained from these procedures represents a net progress toward the assessment of a reliable Sm-147 alpha-decay rate to be used in geo- and cosmo-chronological investigations.

AB Finding an approach for pretreatment of radionuclides from contaminated water are interesting topics of research. In present work, the ZSM-5 molecular sieve was characterized with different techniques such as zeta potential, SEM, FT-IR and XRD to clarify the surface properties of sample and applied as a sorbent to concentrate and recover Cs(I) from aqueous solution. The effect of environmental conditions such as contact time, ionic strength, content of sorbent and solution pH on Cs(I) uptake were optimized using batch techniques. Different kinetic and isotherm models were utilized to evaluate the experimental data and the correlation parameters were obtained. Based on the sorption/desorption experiment, it can be deduced that the ZSM-5 molecular sieve has potential application for the rapid and quantitative recovery of radiocesium from wastewater.

AB This paper describes a question answering framework that can answer student questions given in natural language. We suggest a methodology that makes use of reliable resources only, provides the answer in the form of a multi-document summary for both factoid and open-ended questions, and produces an answer also from foreign resources by translating into the native language. The resources are compiled using a question database in the selected domains based on reliability and coverage metrics. A question is parsed using a dependency parser, important parts are extracted by rule-based and statistical methods, the question is converted into a representation, and a query is built. Documents relevant to the query are retrieved from the set of resources. The documents are summarized and the answers to the question together with other relevant information about the topic of the question are shown to the user. A summary answer from the foreign resources is also built by the translation of the input question and the retrieved documents. The proposed approach was applied to the Turkish language and it was tested with several experiments and a pilot study. The experiments have shown that the summaries returned include the answer for about 50-60 percent of the questions. The data bank built for factoid and open-ended questions in the two domains covered is made publicly available.

AB Large-scale infrastructure projects have important strategic positions in economy and social development, especially in developing countries, and are growing constantly larger and more complex. During the life cycle of a large-scale infrastructure project, technological problems and environmental and socio-economic impacts drive relevant scientific research. However, few empirical studies have been conducted to examine the interaction between project and research. In this paper, we use the Three Gorges Project (TGP), which is the world's largest hydropower project, as a case study to find the patterns of scientific research on specific large-scale infrastructure projects. Text mining and other quantitative methods have been used to reveal: (1) the growth of the publication outputs of the TGP relevant research, (2) major research topics and their temporal trends and (3) the effects of language and corresponding author's nationality on topic proportions in papers. We find that topics of engineering issues were discussed more in domestic journals and in earlier stage of the project's life cycle. Meanwhile, topics of environmental issues were discussed more in international journals and became increasingly popular during the life cycle of the project. These findings are useful for policy-makers and project managers to better establish collaborations with the academia and to more properly allocate resources in future project management practices.

To resolve this problem and make the knowledge convenient for acquisition, machine-understandable and human-understandable, this paper proposes a framework of semantic hyper-graph-based knowledge representation to support the knowledge sharing for the product development. A case study of car headlamp development is given to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results bring out that it can help engineers to rapidly and accurately acquire knowledge. In future research, the knowledge recommendation service based on product development process should be considered.

AB Remote Monitoring Technology (RMT) is recognised as one of the key enablers of servitization. While servitization has been the subject of intense research for years, the role of RMT therein has been less explored. This paper aims to contribute to this important topic by addressing the following research questions: what are the benefits of RMT and how do they support servitization? An exploratory multiple-case study of four manufacturing companies, operating in aerospace, industrial equipment, marine, and transportation sector, was conducted. The research makes three contributions. Firstly, it is the first systematic study of the benefits of RMT and their role in servitization. Secondly, it recognises the centrality of the RMT challenge for the relationship between RMT and servitization. Finally, it explores the implications of the RMT challenge for this relationship. Three implications have been identified, which suggest a novel perspective on the nature of RMT, RMT-enabled services, and their role in servitization.

AB The false discovery rate (FDR) is a powerful approach to multiple testing. However, dependence among test statistics is critical for FDR control. The way in which this dependence structure is described represents the most prominent source of uncertainty of this statistical theme. Copulas play a relevant role among the techniques used to deal with uncertainty and dependence. This paper contributes to fill an existing gap in the scientific debate by exploring the connections between the literature on FDR and that on copulas. In particular, we aim at attracting the interest of the scientific community on this topic by identifying suitable classes of nonstandard copulas which ensure that FDR control can be attained for dependent test statistics.

AB The fatigue characteristics of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) material, such as silicon or polysilicon, have become very important. Many studies have focused on this topic, but none have defined a good methodology for extracting the applied stress and predicting fatigue life accurately. In this study, a methodology was developed for the life prediction of a polysilicon microstructure under bending tests. Based on the fatigue experiments conducted by Hocheng et al. (2008, "Various Fatigue Testing of Polycrystalline Silicon Microcantilever Beam in Bending," Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., 47, pp. 5256-5261) and (Hung and Hocheng, 2012, "Frequency Effects and Life Prediction of Polysilicon Microcantilever Beams in Bending Fatigue," J. Micro/Nanolithogr., MEMS MOEMS, 11, p. 021206), cantilever beams with different dimensions were remodeled with mesh control technology using finite element analysis (FEA) software to extract the stress magnitude. The mesh size, anchor boundary, loading boundary, critical stress definition, and solution type were well modified to obtain more correct stress values. Based on the new stress data extracted from the modified models, the optimized stress-number of life curve (S-N curve) was obtained, and the new life-prediction equation was found to be referable for polysilicon thin film life prediction under bending loads. After comparing the literature and confirming the new models, the frequency effect was observed only for the force control type and not for the displacement control type.

AB This paper analyses the Science curriculum of Primary Education from United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Portugal, Spain and United States of America. The main purpose is to identify whether biological evolution is included on it, either as framework or as content. This international review of the legislation of Primary / Elementary Education has enabled us to deeply compare how such different legal and socio-political contexts deal with this topic. The analysis of the content have shown the existence, or not, of the core ideas to build up the reasoning about the theory of evolution. The results have allowed us to classify the states according to the different degree of introduction of constructs related to the evolution model. Wherever evolution is included in the curriculum, an effective learning progression of the model is actually possible to achieve. Thus, the citizenship would be provided with the knowledge required to make informed decisions on a wide variety of issues related to evolution, both in terms of health and civic responsibility.

AB There are millions of people worldwide-of all ages, conditions, backgrounds, and motivations-with significant learning needs. Unfortunately, traditional education is not efficient enough to meet these needs. That is, the available educational resources are not fully exploited to help cover the demand. There is an increasing need for large-scale access to cost-effective and high-quality education. The use of technological innovations for large-scale teaching might be part of the solution. In this context, the goals of this study were to identify technological innovations that can be considered historical milestones in large-scale teaching, to systematize experts' opinions about the topic, and to propose strategies for the successful implementation of massive open online courses (MOOCs). The researchers identified and analyzed a documentary corpus and found that, in the use of technologies for large-scale teaching, there has been a parallel evolution that have led to the emergence of MOOCs and includes five roots: distance education and online learning, testing or teaching machines and computer-assisted instruction, learning management systems, open education and open educational resources, and online massive teaching. The researchers propose three strategies for the successful implementation of MOOCs: careful consideration of the c/x MOOC pedagogical spectrum characteristics, selection of an appropriate MOOC model, and management of implementation challenges.

AB Mobile phone distracted driving is a recurrent issue in road safety worldwide. Recent research on driving behaviour of distracted drivers suggests that in certain circumstances drivers seem to assume safer behaviours while using a mobile phone. Despite a high volume of research on this topic, self-regulation by mobile phone distracted drivers is not well understood as many driving simulator experiments are designed to impose an equal level of distraction to participants being tested for their driving performance. The aim of this research was to investigate the relationship between self-regulatory secondary task performance and driving. By a driving simulator experiment in which participants were allowed to perform their secondary tasks whenever they feel appropriate, the driving performance of 35 drivers aged 18-29 years was observed under three phone conditions including non-distraction (no phone use), hands-free interactions and visual-manual interactions in the CARRS-Q advanced driving simulator. Drivers' longitudinal and lateral vehicle control observed across various road traffic conditions were then modelled by Generalized Estimation Equations (GEE) with exchangeable correlation structure accounting for heterogeneity resulting from multiple observations from the same driver. Results show that the extent of engagement in the secondary task influence both longitudinal and lateral control of vehicles. Drivers who engaged in a large number of hands-free interactions are found to select lower driving speed. In contrast, longer visual-manual interactions are found to result in higher driving speed among drivers self-regulating their secondary task. Among the road traffic conditions, drivers distracted by their self-regulated secondary tasks are found to select lower speeds along the s-curve compared to straight and motorway segments. In summary, the applied human-machine system approach suggests that road traffic demands play a vital role in both secondary task management and driving performance.

AB Accurate and rapid condition assessment of in-service structural components is critical to ensure safety and serviceability. One major assessment consideration is the detection and quantification of structural section loss due to deterioration, for instance, from corrosion. Modern three-dimensional (3D) imaging techniques, which generate high-resolution 3D point clouds, are capable of detecting and measuring these deteriorations. However, despite advancements in the fields of automated point cloud analysis for as-built modeling and structural inspection, the potential use of spatial 3D data for updating numerical finite-element (FE) models of structures is still an emergent topic. This paper presents a localized methodology for the automatic and systematic detection and quantification of damages in structural components using high-fidelity 3D point cloud data, followed by a corresponding local update to an FE model. In this study, 3D point cloud data of a targeted structure were first obtained by using dense structure from motion (DSfM) algorithms. Section loss damage was then identified and located through computer vision and 3D data processing techniques. In order to preserve data integrity and resolve localized high-fidelity details, direct 3D point cloud comparisons were performed. An experimental study validating the developed approach is presented as well. The results indicate that the presented methodology will enable engineers to use the updated structural model to determine the reserved capacity and remaining service life of structural elements, though further studies on methods to improve mesh generation and defect quantification are warranted.

AB Unreinforced masonry infills are widely used in many parts of the world and it is common practice for seismic design to use simplified methods that usually do not take into account the interaction between the infill and the structure. Starting from the 1950s, many researchers have investigated the lateral response of masonry infills focusing on several different topics. The scientific interest on masonry infills is continuously raising due to the unsatisfactory seismic response of the infilled frame structures observed during post-event inspections and to the difficulty to contrive a widely scientifically and practical recognized solution. Although some modern codes consider the presence of infills with some specifications to prevent damage in the masonry panels and global and local effects on the structure, an effective evaluation of these detrimental effects has not been achieved yet. Within this paper, a FEM simulation of in-plane pseudo-static cyclic tests on a RC frame specimen infilled with unreinforced Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (AAC) masonry infill has been performed in order to study accurately the influence and the interaction of the infill with the RC structure. The experimental results performed by Calvi and Bolognini (J Earthq Eng 5:153-185, 1999), and Penna and Calvi (Campagna sperimentale su telai in c.a. con tamponamenti in Gasbeton (AAC) con diverse soluzioni di rinforzo" (in Italian), 2006) on one-bay one-storey full scale specimens are taken as reference. Non-linear static analyses using a "meso-modelling" approach have been carried out. The masonry used in the model has been calibrated according to tests of mechanical characterization and to in-plane cyclic tests on load-bearing AAC masonry conducted by Costa et al. (J Earthq Eng 15:1-31, 2011). The analyses performed have allowed to investigate the local effects on the frame and, in particular, the changes in the moment and shear demands on the RC elements due to the presence of the AAC infill in comparison with the ones in the bare structure, and to estimate the thrust and the contact length activated by the infill on the frame.

AB Background & Objectives: In healthcare, the routine use of evidence-based specialty care management plans is mixed. Targeted computerized clinical decision support (CCDS) interventions can improve physician adherence, but adoption depends on CCDS' 'fit' within clinical work. We analyzed clinical work in outpatient and inpatient settings as a basis for developing guidelines for optimizing CCDS design.
   Methods: The contextual design approach guided data collection, collation and analysis. Forty (40) consenting physicians were observed and interviewed in general internal medicine inpatient units and gastroenterology (GI) outpatient clinics at two academic medical centers. Data were collated using interpretive debriefing, and consolidated using thematic analysis and three work modeling approaches (communication flow, sequence and artifact models).
   Results: Twenty-six consenting physicians were observed at Site A and 14 at Site B. Observations included attending (33%) and resident physicians. During research team debriefings, 220 of 341 unique topics were categorized into 5 CCDS-relevant themes. Resident physicians relied on patient assessment & planning processes to support their roles as communication and coordination hubs within the medical team. Artifact analysis further elucidated the evolution of assessment and planning over work shifts.
   Conclusions: The usefulness of CCDS tools may be enhanced in clinical care if the design: 1) accounts for clinical work that is distributed across people, space, and time; 2) targets communication and coordination hubs (specific roles) that can amplify the usefulness of CCDS interventions; 3) integrates CCDS with early clinical assessment & planning processes; and 4) provides CCDS in both electronic & hardcopy formats. These requirements provide a research agenda for future research in clinician-CCDS integration.

AB The process of developing a public-private partnership (PPP) is complex and dynamic throughout the project's life cycle of project identification, preparation, procurement, implementation, transfer, and posttransfer phases. Although interests in reviewing general trends and diverse topics of the PPP literature have increased over the years, there is a lack of a systematic review of the PPP literature from the perspective of project life cycle. The purpose of this study is to analyze the research status and possible future studies from the viewpoint of project life cycle. The review is conducted by searching related papers from seven leading construction management journals, then classifying them into distinct phases to facilitate further discussion on significant research topics. The findings show that different PPP phases encounter different problems, attracting uneven attention from researchers. Specifically, the transfer phase, which is the end of PPP contract life cycle and the starting point of posttransfer operation, requires systematic research in the future. The outcomes of this study reveal the relationship between important project problems and corresponding PPP phases, which may serve as valuable reference for PPP participants to develop effective project management strategies, and for PPP researchers to better understand PPP research with specific focus on varied PPP phases.

To provide a better understanding of the quasi-static and dynamic collapses of granular materials and the transitional behavior between these two collapses, a three-dimensional (3D) smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model was developed and used to investigate the collapse of rectangular sand columns with aspect ratios ranging from 0.26 to 11. To model the sand under flow-type failure, the Drucker-Prager constitutive model with nonassociated flow rule was implemented in the SPH formulations. The quasi-static collapse was initiated by slowly moving one of the side walls, and dynamic collapse was modeled by suddenly removing the wall. The SPH results reveal that both quasi-static and dynamic collapses show qualitative similarities and primarily depend on the initial aspect ratio of the column, resulting in two deposit morphologies, including a truncated wedge-like final deposit with a flat surface at the top for small aspect ratios and a wedge-like deposit with a tip for large aspect ratios, which is consistent with experimental observations in the literature. For quasi-static collapse, the final deposit profile (e.g., final height, runout distance) and energy dissipation were theoretically derived and were found to be in close agreement with SPH simulations and experiments. The sensitivity of the deposit profile to the wall velocity was also investigated to provide useful insight into the transitional behavior between quasi-static and dynamic collapses. This sensitivity analysis revealed that the transition between quasi-static and dynamic collapses occurs within a small range of Midi numbers.

AB The strategy of integration known as vendor-managed inventory (VMI), which allows the coordination of inventory policies between producers and buyers in supply chains, has long been considered a strategy for inventory cost reduction. Although the literature acknowledges the importance of understanding the dynamics of VMI implementation through evolutionary games, research in this topic still remains scarce. This paper studies the dynamics of strategic interaction of a producer-buyer supply chain under a newly developed VMI scheme, which makes use of a synchronization mechanism between the buyer and the producer replenishment cycles. By using this alternative VMI representation, we obtain the mathematical conditions that determine the degree of stability of evolutionarily stable strategies. As other evolutionary game theoretical approaches, we also find a lower bound for penalty costs that ensures a VMI contract, but most importantly, we also find how a VMI implementation might depend on the difference between production and demand rates, regardless of any penalty costs.

AB The behaviour of plates resting on elastic foundations has wide interest because it is an important model for many engineering applications. Natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes are guides to investigating the behaviour of a soil-structure system with time. Therefore, free vibration analysis constitutes a considerable part of research done on this topic. In this study, the effects of the stiffness of a surrounding Modified Vlasov soil type, the soil depth, and the aspect ratio on the free vibration of a thin rectangular dowelled plate on the Modified Vlasov soil type are investigated. We used a discrete singular convolution (DSC) with a Taylor series expansion method to apply the boundary conditions. The two formulas of the Taylor series expansion are used in the DSC to eliminate the fictitious points outside the physical domain. It is noticed that beyond a certain depth, neither the effective depth of the soil nor the, frequency varies consistently. Furthermore, the dynamically activated depth influences the frequency values for plates more than for beams. In addition, the effect of the elastic rotational stiffness of the surrounding soil is found to be negligible compared to that of the elastic vertical translational one. The results obtained can serve as a basis for the dynamic analysis of rigid pavements. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This article addresses the nexus of intense urbanization, building energy and air pollution, a topic minimally explored in the literature. The urban heat island effect on building energy demands for cooling and heating is investigated for Beijing through observations and modeling with a coupled Building Effect Parameterization-Building Energy Model and a single building energy model. The average urban heat island intensity in Beijing during summer is approximately 2.02 K, and in winter, this value reaches 3.41 K. The models used for the investigation are forced with observations from two meteorological towers, one located in downtown and the other in the outskirt. Model validation is conducted for environmental variables and for building energy demands against surface weather observations and actual electricity data, showing good agreement in all cases. Results for a 6-storey office building indicate that cooling energy use in the urban area is 36.53 Wm(-2) (30%) higher than the suburban area during summer, while heating energy use is 95.29 Wm(-2) (23%) lower than the suburbs during winter. Residential building shows similar results, with smaller differences in cooling and heating energy use, about 9.14 Wm(-2) (17%) and 92.71 Wm(-2) (20%), respectively. Analysis of clear and polluted winter days shows the impact-chain of air pollution - urban heat island - heating energy use. Heating energy demand is reduced in the urban area during polluted days, corresponding to an enhanced heat island, which may be attributed to a stronger inversion and a lower wind speed.

   ENGINEERING ANALYSIS
AB Solar thermal systems are advantageous since it is easier to store heat than electricity on a large scale. As such, concentrated solar power is receiving considerable interest among researchers, developers and governments. Several concentrated solar power technologies have been developed including the solar tower, the parabolic trough technology, solar dish and linear Fresnel systems. Among them, the parabolic trough solar collector is a proven technology used dominantly for both industrial process heat and power generation. This technology has matured over the years, and its advancement has become the topic of numerous research studies which were the counter driving force of the field. Particularly in recent years, a significant amount of theoretical and numerical studies have been conducted to assess and improve the performance of parabolic trough solar collectors. This review methodologically holds colossal knowledge of current and past studies to assess the optical and thermal performances of parabolic trough solar collectors, modeling approaches and the potential improvements proposed on behalf of the parabolic trough solar collector design. The optical modeling approaches are identified to be analytical and ray-tracing. The review of thermal modeling approaches presents the steady and transient heat transfer analyses of single and two-phase (with direct steam generation) flows. Also, the computational fluid dynamics models used to analyze the physics of parabolic trough solar collectors with a better insight are reviewed and presented. Finally, the studies conducted on the performance improvement of parabolic trough solar collectors are separately examined and presented, these include novel designs, passive heat transfer enhancement, and nanoparticle laden flows.

TI Some considerations to improve the methodology to assess In-Vessel
   Retention strategy for high-power reactors
SO ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY

DT Article
DE Light water reactor; Safety; Severe accident; In-Vessel Retention;
   Corium molten pool; Vessel integrity; IVMR
AB The In-Vessel Retention (IVR) strategy for Light Water Reactors (LWR) intends to stabilize and isolate corium and fission products in the reactor pressure vessel and in the primary circuit. This type of Severe Accident Management (SAM) strategy has already been incorporated in the SAM guidance (SAMG) of several operating small size LWR (reactor below 500 MWe (like VVER440)) and is part of the SAMG strategies for some Gen Ill + PWRs of higher power like the AP1000 or the APR1400. However, for high power reactors, estimations using current level of conservatism show that RPV failure caused by thermo-mechanical rupture takes place in some cases. A better estimation of the residual risk (probability of cases with vessel rupture) requires the use of models with a lower level of conservatism.
   In Europe, the IVMR project aims at providing new experimental data and a harmonized methodology for IVR. A synthesis of the methodology applied to demonstrate the efficiency of IVR strategy for WER-440 in Europe (Finland, Slovakia, Hungary and Czech Republic) was made. It showed very consistent results, following quite comparable methodologies. The main weakness of the demonstration was identified in the evaluation of the heat flux that could be reached in transient situations, e.g. under the "3 layers" configuration, where the "focusing effect" may cause higher heat fluxes than in steady-state (due to transient "thin" metal layer on top). Analyses of various designs of reactors with a power between 900 and 1300 MWe were also made. Different models for the description of the molten pool were used: homogeneous, stratified with fixed configuration, stratified with evolving configuration. The last type of model provides the highest heat fluxes (above 3 MW/m(2)) whereas the first type provides the lowest heat fluxes (around 500 MW/m(2)) but is not realistic due to the non-miscibility of steel with UO2. Obviously, there is a need to reach a consensus about best estimate practices for IVR assessment to be used in the major codes for safety analysis, such as ASTEC, MELCOR, SOCRAT, MAAP, ATHLET-CD, SCDAP/RELAP, etc. Despite the model discrepancies, and leaving aside the unrealistic case of homogeneous pool, the average calculated heat fluxes in many cases are well above 1 MW/m(2) which could reduce the residual thickness of the vessel considerably and threaten its integrity. Therefore, it is clear that the safety demonstration of IVR for high power reactors requires a more careful evaluation of the situations which can lead to formation of either a very thin top metal layer provoking focusing effect or significantly overheated metal, e.g. after oxide and metal layer inversion. It also requires an accurate mechanical analysis of the ablated vessel.
   The current approach followed by most experts for IVR is a compromise between a deterministic analysis using the significant knowledge gained during the last two decades and a probabilistic analysis to take into account large uncertainties due to the lack of data for some physical phenomena (such as transient effects) and due to excessive simplifications of models. A harmonization of the positions of safety authorities on the IVR strategy is necessary to allow decision making based on shared scientific knowledge. Currently, the acceptance criteria of a safety demonstration for IVR may be differently defined from one country to the other and the differences should be further discussed to reach harmonization on this important topic. This includes the accident scenarios to be considered in the demonstration and the modelling of the phenomena in the vessel. Such harmonization is one of the goals of IVMR project. A revised methodology is proposed, where the safety criterion is based not only on a comparison of the heat flux and the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) profiles as in current approaches but also on the minimum vessel thickness reached after ablation and the maximum integral loads that is applied to the vessel during the transient. The main advantage of this revised criterion is in consideration of both steady-state and transient loads on the RPV. Another advantage is that this criterion may be used in both probabilistic and deterministic approaches, whereas the current approaches are mostly deterministic (with deterministic calculations used only for estimates of uncertainty ranges of input parameters).

AB The rapid expansion of Big Data Analytics is forcing companies to rethink their Human Resource (HR) needs. However, at the same time, it is unclear which types of job roles and skills constitute this area. To this end, this study pursues to drive clarity across the heterogeneous nature of skills required in Big Data professions, by analyzing a large amount of real-world job posts published online. More precisely we: 1) identify four Big Data 'job families'; 2) recognize nine homogeneous groups of Big Data skills (skill sets) that are being demanded by companies; 3) characterize each job family with the appropriate level of competence required within each Big Data skill set. We propose a novel, semi-automated, fully replicable, analytical methodology based on a combination of machine learning algorithms and expert judgement. Our analysis leverages a significant amount of online job posts, obtained through web scraping, to generate an intelligible classification of job roles and skill sets. The results can support business leaders and HR managers in establishing clear strategies for the acquisition and the development of the right skills needed to leverage Big Data at best. Moreover, the structured classification of job families and skill sets will help establish a common dictionary to be used by HR recruiters and education providers, so that supply and demand can more effectively meet in the job marketplace.

AB Purpose: Most approaches for quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) are based on a forward model approximation that employs a continuous Fourier transform operator to solve a differential equation system. Such formulation, however, is prone to high-frequency aliasing. The aim of this study was to reduce such errors using an alternative dipole kernel formulation based on the discrete Fourier transform and discrete operators.
   Methods: The impact of such an approach on forward model calculation and susceptibility inversion was evaluated in contrast to the continuous formulation both with synthetic phantoms and in vivo MRI data.
   Results: The discrete kernel demonstrated systematically better fits to analytic field solutions, and showed less over-oscillations and aliasing artifacts while preserving low- and medium-frequency responses relative to those obtained with the continuous kernel. In the context of QSM estimation, the use of the proposed discrete kernel resulted in error reduction and increased sharpness.
   Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study demonstrated that discretizing the dipole kernel is advantageous for QSM. The impact on small or narrow structures such as the venous vasculature might by particularly relevant to high-resolution QSM applications with ultra-high field MRI - a topic for future investigations. The proposed dipole kernel has a straightforward implementation to existing QSM routines.

AB An analysis of discrete systems is important for understanding of various physical processes, such as excitations in crystal lattices and molecular chains, the light propagation in waveguide arrays, and the dynamics of Bose-condensate droplets. In basic physical courses, usually the linear properties of discrete systems are studied. In this paper we propose a pedagogical introduction to the theory of nonlinear distributed systems. The main ideas and methods are illustrated using a universal model for different physical applications, the discrete nonlinear Schrodinger (DNLS) equation. We consider solutions of the DNLS equation and analyse their linear stability. The notions of nonlinear plane waves, modulational instability, discrete solitons and the anti-continuum limit are introduced and thoroughly discussed. A Mathematica program is provided for better comprehension of results and further exploration. Also, a few problems, extending the topic of the paper, for independent solution are given.

AB The paper aims at proposing an original summarization technique from Online Social Networks (OSNs) for multimedia stories' creation. In particular, for each Multimedia Social Network (MuSN) - i.e. an OSN focusing on the management and sharing of multimedia information - we leverage a graph based modeling approach and exploit influence analysis methodologies to detect the most important multimedia objects related to one or more topics of interest. Consecutively, from the list of candidate objects we obtain a multimedia summary on the basis of a novel summarization model and some heuristics, whose purpose is to generate multimedia stories with priority (w.r.t. some user keywords), continuity, variety and not receptiveness features. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by the performed experiments on Flickr. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Classification is one of the most popular topics in healthcare and bioinformatics, especially in relation to arrhythmia detection. Arrhythmias are irregularities in the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat which, in some cases, may occur sporadically in a subject's daily life. To capture these infrequent events, a Holter device is usually employed to record long-term ECG data. Therefore, the automatic recognition of abnormal heartbeats from a large amount of ECG data is an important and essential task. In the last two decades, a huge number of methods have been proposed to address the problem of ECG beat classification. At the same time, deep learning has advanced rapidly since the early 2000s and now demonstrates a state-of-the-art performance in various fields. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for ECG beat classification. We have conducted the experiments on the well-known MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, and compared our results with the scientific literature. The final results show that our model is not only more efficient than the state of the art in terms of accuracy, but also competitive in terms of sensitivity and specificity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Opinion generation is of great value since it provides main opinions for users within a short period of time. The last decade has witnessed a rapid development of social networks and massive data, and it is challenging for people to get the main opinions of short texts within a short period of time. Many studies of pinion generation have used feature weights based methods to summarize these texts sharing the same topic. However, these techniques fail to just regard the original text as the generation without considering the simplicity of language. To overcome the drawback, in this paper, we develop an indicative opinion generation model utilizing BM25 to identify the important text and using syntactic parsing to obtain the brief opinion representation. We first create a vector space model for clustering the short texts using the K-means algorithm. Then, by ranking the short texts sharing the same topic, we obtain the top-ranked representative short texts. Finally, we develop an indicative opinion generation model to obtain the main ideas by using syntactic parsing. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets and evaluate the results by objective and subjective assessments. The experimental results show that our proposed model is effective and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Unsaturated soil mechanics has become a topic of interest among the Sri Lankan geotechnical community owing to its importance in different applications, especially slope stability. In this study, soil samples collected from a landslide area in Sri Lanka were subjected to soil-water retention curve (SWRC) tests and suction-monitored direct shear tests. SWRC tests were conducted on both undisturbed and statically compacted samples and the results were modelled using Van Genutchen equation. The compacted samples having the same dry density as the undisturbed block samples exhibited a similar SWRC. Consolidated drained direct shear tests and suction-monitored direct shear tests were conducted on compacted samples to determine saturated and unsaturated shear strength respectively. The unsaturated shear strength followed a non-linear envelope with respect to matric suction, as shown by a good correlation for the cases of second-order polynomial correlation (R-2 = 0.970) and the prediction using Vanapalli et al. model and SWRC with K = 1.2 (R-2 = 0.941). These test results confirm the validity of using SWRC for predicting unsaturated shear strength of a compacted Sri Lankan silty sand.

AB Purpose of Review Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients and rates in most places have not decreased significantly despite broad efforts by both hospitals and public health entities. This review aims to provide readers with a better understanding of the limitations of current prevention strategies. We also review potential future tools that may be available for the primary prevention of CDI in the next decade.
   Recent Findings Research over the last decade has expanded our appreciation of the role of asymptomatic shedding in the healthcare setting and in the community. This review demonstrates that poor quality data underlies even well-established guidance from national authorities on basic topics such as contact precautions, avoidance of alcohol-based hand hygiene products, CDI testing, supplemental cleaning modalities, and the use of bleach solutions. Additionally, we review research on novel preventative interventions such as identification of asymptomatic carriers, supplemental environmental cleaning technologies, vaccines, and the manipulation of the intestinal microbiome. While there is preliminary data that supports further research in all of these areas, the research is not yet robust enough on which to base local or national policy recommendations, though late-phase human clinical trials of CDI vaccine trials are ongoing.
   Summary Over the last decade, researchers have begun to reassess the traditional infection prevention model for CDI. Data suggesting a greater role for asymptomatic shedders has increased our understanding of current vertical prevention techniques and is forcing researchers to look more at new processes and technologies to decrease disease incidence.

ID CONSTRAINED LEAST-SQUARES; FRAMEWORK
AB Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been widely used in topic modeling of large-scale document corpora, where a set of underlying topics are extracted by a low-rank factor matrix from NMF. However, the resulting topics often convey only general, thus redundant information about the documents rather than information that might be minor, but potentially meaningful to users. To address this problem, we present a novel ensemble method based on nonnegative matrix factorization that discovers meaningful local topics. Our method leverages the idea of an ensemble model, which has shown advantages in supervised learning, into an unsupervised topic modeling context. That is, our model successively performs NMF given a residual matrix obtained from previous stages and generates a sequence of topic sets. The algorithm we employ to update is novel in two aspects. The first lies in utilizing the residual matrix inspired by a state-of-the-art gradient boosting model, and the second stems from applying a sophisticated local weighting scheme on the given matrix to enhance the locality of topics, which in turn delivers high-quality, focused topics of interest to users. We subsequently extend this ensemble model by adding keyword- and document-based user interaction to introduce user-driven topic discovery.

In recent years, deep learning techniques, especially deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), have achieved an astonishing level of performance in image classification. However, the traditional DCNN methods do not focus on multispectral remote sensing images with more than three channels, and they are limited by their training samples. In addition, these methods uniformly decompose large images into small processing units, which chop up the land-use patterns and produce land-use maps with obvious "blocks". In this study, a semi-transfer deep convolutional neural network (STDCNN) approach is proposed to overcome these weaknesses. The proposed STDCNN has three parts: one part involves a transferred DCNN with deep architecture; another part is designed to analyze multispectral images; and the final part fuses the first two parts into a classification layer. Moreover, a skeleton-based decomposing method using street block data is devised to maintain the integrity of the land-use patterns. In two case studies, the proposed method is used to generate urban land-use maps from a WorldView-3 image of a 143 km(2) area of Hong Kong and a WorldView-2 image of a 25 km(2) area of Shenzhen. The results show that the proposed STDCNN obtains an overall accuracy (OA) of 91.25% and a Kappa coefficient (Kappa) of 0.903 for Hong Kong land-use classification, and an OA of 80% and a Kappa of 0.780 for Shenzhen land-use classification. In addition, due to the proposed skeleton-based decomposition method, the proposed method can produce better land-use maps for real-world urban applications.

AB This article elaborates on the seemingly impossible notion that a continuous elastic body subjected to dynamic sources on its outer surface could ever be substituted in all of its essential qualities by a discrete model accomplished with finite elements. This topic is taken up herein and discussed in the context of a very simple two-dimensional model involving the propagation of SH shear waves (or acoustic waves) in a homogeneous elastic half-space. It is shown that there exists at least one discrete solid, referred to here as the Guddati Solid, which from its external surface behaves exactly like the continuum and is able to transmit waves of any frequency and any wavelength. This is a rather surprising finding in that it seems to contradict some well-known elastodynamic representation theorems, not to mention falsify the widespread belief that a discrete system can never behave like the continuum it purports to model. The purpose of this article is thus to present one example which disproves this widely believed postulate.

AB Severe adhesion, also referred to as galling, is a critical problem in press hardening, especially in stamping tools used for hot forming of Al-Si-coated ultra-high strength steel. Galling is known to develop rapidly on the tool surface and it negatively affects the quality of the formed products. Earlier research on this topic has focused on the galling initiation. However, studies on the galling development during extended sliding and the corresponding quantitative measurement still lack depth. In the present study, a tribological test is established to study the galling development under press hardening conditions. The tribological test set-up aims to simulate extended sliding between the Al-Si-coated boron steels and the tool die material. The contact conditions in the interface are studied by a numerical model of the tribological test. The friction coefficients and material transfer are discussed taking into account the variation of the different test conditions. Using the results from the tribological tests, the galling simulation is performed in the numerical model. A geometry-updated sample based on the galling (transferred material build-up) height is simulated and the consequent pressure fluctuation is obtained in the numerical model. This contributes to the explanation of the severe transferred material accumulation during the test.

AB Monocular 3D face reconstruction from a single image has been an active research topic due to its wide applications. It has been demonstrated that the 3D face can be reconstructed efficiently using a PCA-based subspace model for facial shape representation and facial landmarks for model parameter estimation. However, due to the limited expressiveness of the subspace model and the inaccuracy of landmark detection, most existing methods are not robust to pose and illumination variation. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a coupled-dictionary model for parametric facial shape representation and a two-stage framework for 3D face reconstruction from a single 2D image by using facial landmarks. Motivated by image super-resolution, the proposed coupled-model consists of two dictionaries for the sparse and the dense 3D facial shapes, respectively. In the first stage, the sparse 3D face is estimated from facial landmarks by using partial least-squares regression. In the second stage, the dense 3D face is reconstructed by 3D super-resolution on the estimated sparse 3D face. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed coupled-dictionary model outperforms the PCA-based subspace model in 3D face modeling accuracy and that the proposed framework achieves much lower reconstruction error on facial images with pose and illumination variations compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, qualitative analysis demonstrates that the proposed method is generalizable to different types of data, including facial images, portraits, and facial sketches.

AB Outsourcing data storage to the cloud securely and retrieving the remote data in an efficient way is a very significant research topic, with high relevance to secure cloud deployment. With the ever growing security and privacy concerns, encrypting the data stored remotely is inevitable but using traditional encryption thwarts performing search operation on the encrypted data. Encrypted keyword search is a cryptographic setting, which offers search functionality and at the same time, ensures security and privacy of the remotely stored secured data. Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) is a technique to securely outsource the data, which is encrypted using symmetric key primitives, while maintaining search functionality. In this paper, we consider Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) in the presence of a Semi-Honest-But-Curious Cloud Service Provider (SHBC-CSP) and, defined a new security notion for SSE in presence of SHBC-CSP, contrived two new SSE schemes and proved their security formally in the proposed security notion. The dynamic verifiable encrypted keyword search proposed in this paper is the first SSE scheme to the best of our knowledge, which is both dynamic and verifiable. As an initial step, we have designed a verifiable encrypted keyword search solution and later, we have extended the research to make it both dynamic and verifiable. Also, we compare the performance metrics of our schemes with other existing schemes.

AB The use of allotropic phases of carbon (i.e. nanotubes, graphene or carbon nanofibers) as second phases to design ceramic composites is a hot topic at present. Researchers try to provide a remarkable improvement of the parent ceramic assuming that some of the outstanding mechanical properties of these phases migrate to the resultant composite. This reasonable idea has been questioned severely in the case of nanotubes addition but there is not any analysis for the other two phases cited previously. To elucidate this question, zirconia was selected as a model ceramic. This paper reports the mechanical properties of zirconia composites reinforced either with graphene or carbon nanofibers, with special emphasis on the high-temperature plasticity.

Among the main themes discussed were those of rough surface representations, the breakdown of continuum theories at the nano- and microscales, as well as multiscale and multiphysics aspects for analytical and computational models relevant to applications spanning a variety of sectors, from automotive to biotribology and nanotechnology. Significant effort is still required to account for complementary nonlinear effects of plasticity, adhesion, friction, wear, lubrication and surface chemistry in tribological models. For each topic, we propose some research directions.

AB With the continuous development of remote sensing techniques, an enormous amount of remote sensing data is collected by observing the earth. The method by which researchers mine the relevant knowledge accurately and efficiently from remote sensing big data remains a topic of interest. The existing model mining algorithms usually rely on a priori knowledge, and cannot meet the actual needs of remote sensing data mining. This paper proposes distributed correlation model mining from remote sensing big data based on gene expression programming (DCMM-GEP) combined with cloud computing to find a better model for remote sensing big data using an abnormal value recognition algorithm based on residual sum of residual (AVR-RSR) and a global model generation algorithm for remote sensing big data based on linear least squares (GMGRS-LLS). Comparative experiments show that DCMM-GEP outperforms both distributed correlation model mining based on genetic programming and genetic algorithms, showing better average time-consumption, R-square values and prediction accuracy. The comparative results also show that with an increasing number of computing nodes, DCMM-GEP has a good speed-up ratio and scale-up ratio.

AB The crash safety of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has recently become a hot research topic because of the wide application of LIBs in vehicle. This paper investigates how packing design of battery cells influence the energy density (volume specific) and structural of LIB pack. Firstly, three packing geometrical parameters (one packing angle parameter and two cell number parameters) are extracted to describe the packing modes, packing density and sizes of the module. Then a detailed computational model is established and validated through experiments, with the implementation of a failure criterion for short-circuit. An anisotropic elasto-plastic model is introduced to describe the mechanical response of the cylindrical jellyroll. Based on the computational results, we quantitatively describe the relationship between structural strength and packing parameters of battery module. The deduced empirical equations from the model are validated against numerical examples, and provide a reliable path to predict the mechanical integrity of battery packs with the knowledge of packing information. This developed modeling approach can serve as an efficient tool for safety design of LIB packs.

AB There is an ongoing trend towards the consumption of organic food in many industrialized countries. For food producers and marketers, it is interesting to know the determinants of organic food consumption. The great majority of previous research on this topic was based on consumer surveys or interviews with questions on past or future behaviour or attitudes towards organic food. However, there is a potential bias in these measures. The aim of the present study was therefore to determine the drivers of actual organic food purchases and compare them with the drivers of attitudes towards organic food. The analysis was based on household panel data from Germany provided by the company GfK documenting all food purchases of N = 9470 households during the entire year of 2008. The data on actual purchases of organic food were linked with survey data from the same households on attitudes towards different food characteristics. The analysis confirmed the phenomenon of an attitude-behaviour gap in the market for organic food. Nevertheless, the structural equation models provided evidence that attitudes towards organic food and organic food purchases were both driven by the same determinants; however, the relative importance of the determinants differed. In both models, 'naturalness and healthiness' and 'environmental protection' were the two most influential drivers. Other significant determinants with a positive influence were the preference for 'local and domestic food' and the desire for 'high quality food and enjoyment of eating'; 'price consciousness' and 'convenience orientation' both had a significant negative effect. The paper concludes with implications for future survey research on organic food and recommendations for producers and marketers of organic food.

AB Market prediction has been an important machine learning research topic in recent decades. A neglected issue in prediction is having a model that can simultaneously pay attention to the interaction of global markets along historical data of the target markets being predicted. As a solution, we present a hybrid supervised semi-supervised model called HyS3 for direction of movement prediction. The graph-based semi-supervised part of HyS3 models the markets global interactions through a network designed with a novel continuous Kruskal-based graph construction algorithm called ConKruG. The supervised part of the model injects results extracted from each market's historical data to the network whenever the hybrid model allows with an innovative conditional mechanism. The significance of higher prediction accuracy of HyS3 is comparing to other models is proved statistically against other models including supervised models and network-based semi-supervised predictions.

AB Cross-age face recognition has remained a popular research topic as most regular facial recognition systems have failed in dealing with facial changes through age. In order to enhance the system's capability of discriminating facial identity features in spite of age changes, this paper proposes a novel deep convolutional network method for cross-age face recognition called age-related factor guided joint task modeling convolutional neural networks, which combines an identity discrimination network with an age discrimination network that shares the same feature layers. By alternatively training the fusion networks and the combined factor model, the cross-age identity features and cross-identity age features can be effectively separated with high inter-class distension and intra-class compactness. Extensive experiments have been performed on the benchmark aging data sets, including MORPH, CACD-VS, and Cross Age LFW. The results have demonstrated the superiority and effectiveness of our model.

AB Electrochemical state estimation of a lithiumion battery provides crucial information to the battery management system about its state of charge and state of health. Insight into nonmeasurable electrochemical states, such as bulk and surface concentration, holds the key to improving safety, predicting degradation, and facilitating a wider range of battery operation. Although strategies to estimate concentration in a single electrode are wellresearched, the topic of simultaneous concentration estimation in both electrodes is not fully investigated. Real-time knowledge of lithium concentration in both electrodes will be essential in setting operational limits specific to the electrode chemistry, enabling estimation of available power in each electrode, and developing algorithms to monitor or minimize degradation mechanisms occurring at either electrode. To that end, an interconnected sliding mode observer is proposed for the concurrent estimation of bulk and surface concentration in the cathode and anode. An experimentally validated enhanced single particle model forms the basis for the electrochemical-model-based observer design. The novel bidirectional structure of the interconnected observer circumvents the issue associated with the combined concentration estimation in both electrodes. The convergence of the interconnected observer's error dynamics is proved using Lyapunov's stability theory and its performance is verified under measurement noise and parametric uncertainties.

AB The present study is an attempt to investigate Iranian EFL learners' willingness to speak English in language classrooms, and the situational and individual factors that influence their willingness to speak. The study adopts a primarily quantitative approach, followed by qualitative data aimed at expanding and elaborating on the quantitative data. One hundred and fifty six EFL learners took part in the study. A researcher-made Willingness to Speak questionnaire was used to measure willingness to speak. To shed more light on learners' willingness to speak, semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven participants in order to arrive at richer findings. Several factors were identified as having an influence on learners' willingness to speak, including topic of discussion, effect of interlocutor, shyness, self-confidence, teacher, and classroom atmosphere. Results can bring about pedagogical implications for language educators and curriculum developers.

AB Climate change communication efforts grounded in the information deficit model have largely failed to close the gap between scientific and public understanding of the risks posed by climate change. In response, simulations have been proposed to enable people to learn for themselves about this complex and politically charged topic. Here we assess the impact of a widely-used simulation, World Climate, which combines a socially and emotionally engaging role-play with interactive exploration of climate change science through the CROADS climate simulation model. Participants take on the roles of delegates to the UN climate negotiations and are challenged to create an agreement that meets international climate goals. Their decisions are entered into C-ROADS, which provides immediate feedback about expected global climate impacts, enabling them to learn about climate change while experiencing the social dynamics of negotiations. We assess the impact of World Climate by analyzing pre- and post-survey results from >2,000 participants in 39 sessions in eight nations. We find statistically significant gains in three areas: (i) knowledge of climate change causes, dynamics and impacts; (ii) affective engagement including greater feelings of urgency and hope; and (iii) a desire to learn and do more about climate change. Contrary to the deficit model, gains in urgency were associated with gains in participants' desire to learn more and intent to act, while gains in climate knowledge were not. Gains were just as strong among American participants who oppose government regulation of free markets-a political ideology that has been linked to climate change denial in the US-suggesting the simulation's potential to reach across political divides. The results indicate that World Climate offers a climate change communication tool that enables people to learn and feel for themselves, which together have the potential to motivate action informed by science.

AB Human impact on the environment leads to the release of many pollutants that produce artificial compounds, which can have harmful effects on the body's endocrine system; these are known as endocrine disruptors (EDO. Nonylphenol (NP) is a chemical compound with a nonyl group that is attached to a phenol ring. NP-induced H(2)AX is a sensitive genotoxic biomarker for detecting possible DNA damage; it also causes male infertility and carcinogenesis. We attempt to comprehensively review all the available evidence about the different ways with descriptive mechanisms for explaining the possible DNA damage that is induced by NP. We systematically searched several databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and gray literature, such as Google Scholar by using medical subheading (MeSH) terms and various combinations of selected keywords from January 1970 to August 2017. The initial search identified 62,737 potentially eligible studies; of these studies, 33 were included according to the established inclusion criteria. Thirty-three selected studies, include the topics of animal model (n = 21), cell line (n = 6), human model (n = 4), microorganisms (n = 1), solid DNA (n = 1), infertility (n = 4), apoptosis (n = 6), and carcinogenesis (n = 3). This review highlighted the possible deleterious effects of NP on DNA damage through the ability to produce ROS/RNS. Finally, it is significant to observe caution at this stage with the continued use of environmental pollutants such as NP, which may induce DNA damage and apoptosis.

AB Nano-ecotoxicology is extensively debated and nanomaterial surface reactivity is an emerging topic. Iron oxide nanoparticles are widely applied, with organic or inorganic coatings for stabilizing their suspensions. Surface active maghemite nanoparticles (SAMNs) are the unique example of naked iron oxide displaying high colloidal and structural stability in water and chemical reactivity. The colloidal behavior of SAMNs was studied as a function of the medium salinity and protocols of acute and chronic toxicity on Daphnia magna were consequently adapted. SAMN distribution into the crustacean, intake/depletion rates and swimming performances were evaluated. No sign of toxicity was detected in two model organisms from the first trophic level (P. subcapitata and L. minor). In D. magna, acute EC50 values of SAMN was assessed, while no sub-lethal effects were observed and the accumulation of SAMNs in the gut appeared as the sole cause of mortality. Fast depuration and absence of delayed effects indicated no retention of SAMNs within the organism. In spite of negligible toxicity on D. magna adults, SAMN surface reactivity was responsible of membrane bursting and lethality on embryos. The present study offers a contribution to the nascent knowledge concerning the impact of nanoparticle surface reactivity on biological interfaces.

AB Biofilm has become a major topic of interest in medical, food, industrial, and environmental bacteriology. To be relevant, investigation of biofilm behavior requires effective and reliable techniques. We present herein a simple and robust method, adapted from the microplate technique, in which steam is used as a soft washing method to preserve biofilm integrity and to improve reproducibility of biofilm quantification. The kinetics of steam washing indicated that the method is adapted to remove both planktonic bacteria and excess crystal violet (CV) staining for S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. carnosus, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli biofilm. Confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed that steam washing preserved the integrity of the biofilm better than pipette-based washing. We also investigated the measurement of the turbidity of biofilm resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as an alternative to staining with CV. This approach allows the discrimination of biofilm producer strains from non-biofilm producer strains in a way similar to CV staining, and subsequently permits quantification of viable bacteria present in biofilm by culture enumeration from the same well. Biofilm quantification using steam washing and PBS turbidity reduced the technical time needed, and data were highly reproducible.

AB Background: Blended learning (BL) is a learning innovation that applies the concept of face-to-face learning and online learning. However, examples of these innovations are still limited in the teaching of postgraduate education within the field of family medicine. Malaysian postgraduate clinical training, is an in-service training experience and face-to-face teaching with the faculty members can be challenging. Given this, we took the opportunity to apply BL in their training. This study provides an exploration of the perceptions of the educators and students toward the implementation of BL.
   Methods: A qualitative approach was employed using focus group discussions (FGD) and in-depth interviews (IDI) at an academic centre that trains family physicians. Twelve trainees, all of whom were in their hospital specialty's rotations and five faculty members were purposively selected. Three FGDs among the trainees, one FGD and two IDIs among the faculty members were conducted using a semi-structured topic guide. Data were collected through audio-recorded interviews, transcribed verbatim and checked for accuracy. A thematic approach was used to analyse the data.
   Results: There were four main themes that emerged from the analysis. Both educators and trainees bill the perspective that BL encouraged continuity in learning. They agreed that BL bridges the gap in student-teacher interactions. Although educators perceived that BL is in concordance with trainees learning style, trainees felt differently about this. Some educators and trainees perceived BL to be an extra burden in teaching and learning.
   Conclusion: This study highlights a mix positive and negative perceptions of BL by educators and trainees. BL were perceived positively for continuity in learning and student-teacher interaction. However, educator and learner have mismatched perception of learning style. BL was also perceived to cause extra burden to both educators and learners. Integrating BL to a traditional learning curriculum is still a challenge. By knowing the strengths of BL in this setting, family medicine trainees in Malaysia can use it to enhance their current learning experience. Future study can investigate different pedagogical designs that suit family medicine trainees and educators in promoting independent learning in postgraduate training.

AB Community detection in time series networks represents a timely and significant research topic due to its applications in a broad range of scientific fields, including biology, social sciences and engineering. In this work, we introduce methodology to address this problem, based on a decomposition of the network adjacency matrices into low-rank components that capture the community structure and sparse & dense noise perturbation components. It is further assumed that the low-rank structure exhibits sharp changes (phase transitions) at certain epochs that our methodology successfully detects and identifies. The latter is achieved by averaging the low-rank component over time windows, which in turn enables us to precisely select the correct rank and monitor its evolution over time and thus identify the phase transition epochs. The methodology is illustrated on both synthetic networks generated by various network formation models, as well as the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators and on real data reflecting the US Senate's voting record from 1979-2014. In the latter application, we identify that party polarization exhibited a sharp change and increased after 1993, a finding broadly concordant with the political science literature on the subject.

AB Zeolite-templated carbons (ZTCs) comprise a relatively recent material class synthesized via the chemical vapor deposition of a carbon-containing precursor on a zeolite template, followed by the removal of the template. We have developed a theoretical framework to generate a ZTC model from any given zeolite structure, which we show can successfully predict the structure of known ZTCs. We use our method to generate a library of ZTCs from all known zeolites, to establish criteria for which zeolites can produce experimentally accessible ZTCs, and to identify over 10 ZTCs that have never before been synthesized. We show that ZTCs partition space into two disjoint labyrinths that can be described by a pair of interpenetrating nets. Since such a pair of nets also describes a triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS), our results establish the relationship between ZTCs and schwarzites-carbon materials with negative Gaussian curvature that resemble TPMSs-linking the research topics and demonstrating that schwarzites should no longer be thought of as purely hypothetical materials.

AB As a frontier topic of soft condensed matter physics, irreversible aggregation has drawn attention for a better understanding of the complex behavior of biomaterials. In this study, we have described the synthesis of an artificial amphiphilic molecule, an alternating tetrablock-like amphiphile, which was able to diversify its aggregate structure in water. The aggregated state of its aqueous dispersion was obtained by slow evaporation of the organic solvent at room temperature, and it collapsed irreversibly at - 50 degrees C. By using a cryo-transmission electron microscope and a differential scanning calorimeter, it was revealed that two types of molecular nanostructures were formed and developed into submicro- and micrometer-sized fibrils in the aggregated material.

AB Over the past few years, updated editorial policy statements of several associations have provided a platform for improving the quality of scientific research and publishing. The updates have particularly pointed to the need for following research reporting standards, authorship and contributorship regulations, implementing digital tools for the identification and crediting academic contributors, and moving towards optimal ethical open-access models. This article overviews some of the recent editorial policy statements of global editorial associations and reflects on the role of the regional counterparts in advancing scholarly publishing. One of the globally promoted documents is the Recommendations of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). Its latest versions contain statements on proper research reporting, reviewing, editing, and publishing. Points on ethical target journals and 'predatory' sources are also available. This year, in a move to update its editorial policy, the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) released the Core Practices, comprehensively reflecting on the major issues in publication ethics. Updated joint statements of medical writers associations are also available to implement transparent policy on contributorship in sponsor-supported research projects and related reports. Several suggestions are put forward to improve global editorial statements on online profiling, crediting, and referencing. It is also highlighted that knowledge and implementation of updated editorial guidance is essential for editors' good standing.

AB Background: The insula is one of the most researched brain regions with many highly cited papers. However, unlike the literature of other fields, there is currently no study that has identified the 100 most cited papers within the literature of the insula. The aim of the current study was to fill in the knowledge gap by determining which publications concerning the insula have been cited most often, who contributed to them, and what topics they were dealing with.
   Methods: The Web of Science online database was searched to identify the 100 most cited publications mentioning the insular cortex in their titles, abstracts or keywords. To systematically exclude irrelevant publications, the search strategy was finalized as: TS = (insula OR insular OR "island of Reil") NOT TS = ("insular biogeography" OR "insular mammal*" OR "*insular lymphatic*") NOT WC = ("Geochemistry and Geophysics" OR "Ecology"). The identified publications were sorted in descending order of citation count. The 100 most cited publications concerning the insula of the brain were identified and their bibliometric data was extracted and assessed. The VOSviewer software was used with default parameters to generate a bubble map that analyzes and visualizes the words/phrases used in the titles and abstracts of the publications.
   Results: There were 67 articles on experiments/lab studies and 33 meta-analyses/reviews but no opinion or methods paper. They had an average of 943.4 citations (or 62.9 citations per year), 93.5 references and 13.4 pages. There were 35 papers published in open access. USA was the major contributing country. The most top-ranked publications were concerning emotion, salience and pain.
   Conclusion: Two-thirds of the publications concerned the normal brain function/mechanism (n = 67), whereas 20 publications concerned disease/therapeutic intervention and another 13 concerned normal anatomy. For the 67 original articles, 57 used human subjects whereas 10 used animal models. MRI was the commonest modality (n = 37), followed by PET (n = 16). Nine articles investigated by histology, two by multiple modalities and three by other modality.

AB Cloud computing is an Internet-based computing and networking model, with elasticity and scalability capabilities where the services are delivered to its users in a non-demand style. In this computing paradigm, the request and response between users and providers must be managed using the resource allocation strategies. Therefore, allocating the provided resources to the users based on their needs is the important challenge in this environment. Also, an auction in the cloud is a process of buying and vending the cloud services by offering them up for bid and then selling the service to the highest bidder. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been any comprehensive and detailed paper about reviewing the state-of-the-art mechanisms on this important topic and providing open issues as well. Hence, this paper provides a comprehensive survey and review of the auction-based resource allocation mechanisms, which have been employed in the cloud environments up to now. Also, we classified the important cloud resource allocation mechanisms into four categories: one-sided, double-sided, combinatorial, and other types of auction-based mechanisms. Moreover, we reviewed the main progress in these four categories and defined the new issues. Finally, the paper offers the differences among reviewed mechanisms as well as guidelines for future investigation.

DE tagging augmented neural topic model; Web service discovery; word

AB Search engine based Web service discovery model suffers from the semantic sparsity problem due to the fact that Web services are described in short texts, which in turn leads to poor recall. To address this issue, external information that enriches the semantics of the Web service and improves discovery performance has been highly concerned. In light of this, we propose a novel Web service discovery approach that uses the neural topic model, which seamlessly integrates tagging information and word embedding for semantic sparsity problem. More specifically, instead of clustering Web services as done in most existing service discovery approaches, we use word embedding to map the words as continuous embeddings to embody external semantics of the service description. We also leverage the neural topic model in service discovery, which takes continuous word distribution as the input and interprets the Web service description as a hierarchical model. Based on the neural topic model and word embedding, we propose an efficient Web service query and ranking approach. Experiments conducted on a real-world Web service dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Ecological Network Analysis (ENA) combines modeling and analysis used to investigate the structure, function, and evolution of ecosystems and other complex systems. ENA is applied to network models that trace the movement of thermodynamically conserved energy or matter through the system. Investigators use ENA to answer a range of questions such as the following. What is the impact of fishing on the marine food web? Which species control the flux of nitrogen in an estuary? What is the ecological relationship among species in the food web when direct and indirect influences are considered? Would a proposed regulation make a city more sustainable? The field has grown since its inception in the 1970s, but it has rarely been systematically reviewed. This absence of reviews likely hinders the development of the field as a whole, obscures the diversity of its applications, and makes it difficult for new investigators to learn, develop, and apply the techniques. The objective of the work presented in this paper was to systematically review ENA research published in 2010 through 2016 to (1) identify the topic diversity, (2) expose methodological development, (3) highlight applications, and (4) assess collaboration among ENA scholars. To accomplish this, we used a combination of bibliometric, network (e.g., social network), and feature analyses. Our search identified 186 records. A topic network built from the bibliographic records revealed eight major topic clusters. The largest groups centered on food webs, urban metabolism, and ecosystem theory. Co-author analysis identified 387 authors in a collaboration network with eight larger components. The largest component contained 56% of the authors. This review shows ENA to be a topically diverse and collaborative science domain, and suggests opportunities to further develop ENA to better address issues in theoretical ecology and for environmental impact assessment and management.

AB Objective: To provide a parsimonious clustering pipeline that provides comparable performance to deep learning-based clustering methods, but without using deep learning algorithms, such as autoencoders.
   Materials and methods: Clustering was performed on six benchmark datasets, consisting of five image datasets used in object, face, digit recognition tasks (COIL20, COIL100, CMU-PIE, USPS, and MNIST) and one text document dataset (REUTERS-10K) used in topic recognition. K-means, spectral clustering, Graph Regularized Non-negative Matrix Factorization, and K-means with principal components analysis algorithms were used for clustering. For each clustering algorithm, blind source separation (BSS) using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was applied. Unsupervised feature learning (UFL) using reconstruction cost ICA (RICA) and sparse filtering (SFT) was also performed for feature extraction prior to the cluster algorithms. Clustering performance was assessed using the normalized mutual information and unsupervised clustering accuracy metrics.
   Results: Performing, ICA BSS after the initial matrix factorization step provided the maximum clustering performance in four out of six datasets (COIL100, CMU-PIE, MNIST, and REUTERS-10K). Applying UFL as an initial processing component helped to provide the maximum performance in three out of six datasets (USPS, COIL20, and COIL100). Compared to state-of-the-art non-deep learning clustering methods, ICA BSS and/ or UFL with graph-based clustering algorithms outperformed all other methods. With respect to deep learning-based clustering algorithms, the new methodology presented here obtained the following rankings: COIL20, 2nd out of 5; COIL100, 2nd out of 5; CMU-PIE, 2nd out of 5; USPS, 3rd out of 9; MNIST, 8th out of 15; and REUTERS-10K, 4th out of 5.
   Discussion: By using only ICA BSS and UFL using RICA and SFT, clustering accuracy that is better or on par with many deep learning-based clustering algorithms was achieved. For instance, by applying ICA BSS to spectral clustering on the MNIST dataset, we obtained an accuracy of 0.882. This is better than the well-known Deep Embedded Clustering algorithm that had obtained an accuracy of 0.818 using stacked denoising autoencoders in its model.

AB As the most common examination tool in medical practice, chest radiography has important clinical value in the diagnosis of disease. Thus, the automatic detection of chest disease based on chest radiography has become one of the hot topics in medical imaging research. Based on the clinical applications, the study conducts a comprehensive survey on computer-aided detection (CAD) systems, and especially focuses on the artificial intelligence technology applied in chest radiography. The paper presents several common chest X-ray datasets and briefly introduces general image preprocessing procedures, such as contrast enhancement and segmentation, and bone suppression techniques that are applied to chest radiography. Then, the CAD system in the detection of specific disease (pulmonary nodules, tuberculosis, and interstitial lung diseases) and multiple diseases is described, focusing on the basic principles of the algorithm, the data used in the study, the evaluation measures, and the results. Finally, the paper summarizes the CAD system in chest radiography based on artificial intelligence and discusses the existing problems and trends.

AB Background. The aim of the study was to investigate the practice and pattern of smokeless tobacco (SLT) use as well as the knowledge and perception about its ill effects among rural Bangladeshi adolescents.
   Methods. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among students aged 13-18 years in two rural secondary schools in Bangladesh in August 2015. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire which consists of topics derived from the Social Cognitive Theory and Health Belief Model (personal characteristics, environmental factors, self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and cues to action). Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 24. A descriptive analysis was conducted to determine the current pattern of SLT use and knowledge about its ill effects. A chi-square test and Fisher exact test were conducted to explore associations between variables. Lastly, a logistic regression model was used to locate the predictors for current SLT use.
   Results. A total of 790 students participated in the study. Among them, 9.5% (75) had used SLT at least once and 3.7% (29) were current SLT users. Males had a higher incidence of SLT use compared with females. The majority of students (77.3%) initiated SLT use between 10-13 years of age. 'Zarda' was the most common type of SLT used and most of the current users (86%) were able to buy SLT without age restrictions. Most of the current users (90%) wanted to quit SLT immediately; however, professional help was not available in schools. Overall, students had a good knowledge about the harmful effects of SLT with 54.8% (428) of respondents scoring in the good knowledge category. However, the majority of never SLT users (55.4%; 396) had a good knowledge compared to ever SLT users (42.7%; 32). Significant predictors of current SLT use included being a student aged 14 years and above (OR = 6.58, 95% CI [2.23-28.31]) as well as the variables of self-efficacy (OR = 5.78, 95% CI [1.46-19.65]), perceived barriers (OR = 0.30, 95% CI [0.10-0.74]), perceived benefit (OR = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05-1.03]) and perceived severity (OR = 0.36, 95% CI [0.16-0.91]).
   Discussion. This study demonstrates the need for comprehensive prevention and control programme in rural schools targeting young adolescents. Effective measure should be taken to reshape the attitude of rural adolescents towards self-confidence and competence, as to prevent SLT use.

AB Discovery and development of enzymes for the synthesis of chiral amines have been a hot topic for basic and applied aspects of biocatalysts. Based on our X-ray crystallographic analyses of porcine kidney D-amino acid oxidase (pkDAO) and its variants, we rationally designed a new variant that catalyzed the oxidation of (S)-4-Cl-benzhydrylamine (CBHA) from pkDAO and obtained it by functional high-throughput screening with colorimetric assay. The variant I230A/R283G was constructed from the variant R283G which had completely lost the activity for D-amino acids, further gaining new activity toward (S)-chiral amines with the bulky substituents. The variant enzyme (I230A/R283G) was characterized to have a catalytic efficiency of 1.85 s(-1) for (S)-CBHA, while that for (R)-1-phenylethylamine was diminished 10-fold as compared with the Y228L/R283G variant. The variant was efficiently used for the synthesis of (R)-CBHA in 96% ee from racemic CBHA by the deracemization reaction in the presence of reducing agent such as NaBH4 in water. Furthermore, X-ray crystallographic analysis of the new variant complexed with (S)-CBHA, together with modelling study clearly showed the basis of understanding the structure-activity relationship of pkDAO.

AB Empirical evidence and conceptual elaboration reveal and rationalize the remarkable affinity of organic ionic liquids for biomembranes. Cations of the so-called room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), in particular, are readily absorbed into the lipid fraction of biomembranes, causing a variety of observable biological effects, including generic cytotoxicity, broad antibacterial potential, and anticancer activity. Chemical physics analysis of model systems made of phospholipid bilayers, RTIL ions, and water confirm and partially explain this evidence, quantifying the mild destabilizing effect of RTILs on the structural, dynamic, and thermodynamic properties of lipids in biomembranes. Our Feature Article presents a brief introduction to these systems and to their roles in biophysics and biotechnology, summarizing recent experimental and computational results on their properties. More importantly, it highlights the many developments in pharmacology, biomedicine, and bionanotechnology expected from the current research effort on this topic. To anticipate future developments, we speculate on (i) potential applications of (magnetic) RTILs to affect and control the rheology of cells and biological tissues, of great relevance for diagnostics and (ii) the use of RTILs to improve the durability, reliability, and output of biomimetic photovoltaic devices.

AB Understanding how transcription factors (TFs) regulate mammalian gene expression in space and time is a central topic in biology. To activate a gene, a TF has first to diffuse in the available space of the nucleus until it reaches a target DNA sequence or protein (target site). This eventually results in the recruitment of the whole transcriptional machinery. All these processes take place in the mammalian nucleoplasm, a highly organized and dynamic environment, in which some complexes transiently assemble and break apart, whereas others appear more stable. This diversity of dynamic behaviors arises from the number of biomolecules that make up the nucleoplasm and their pairwise interactions. Indeed, interactions energies that span several orders of magnitude, from covalent bounds to transient and dynamic interactions, can shape nuclear landscapes. Thus, the nuclear environment determines how frequently and how fast a TF contacts its target site, and it indirectly regulates gene expression. How exactly transient interactions are involved in the regulation of TF diffusion is unclear, but are reflected by live cell imaging techniques, including single-particle tracking (SPT). Overall, the macroscopic result of these microscopic interactions is almost always anomalous diffusion, a phenomenon widely studied and modeled. Here, we review the connections between the anomalous diffusion of a TF observed by SPT and the microscopic organization of the nucleus, including recently described topologically associated domains and dynamic phase-separated compartments. We propose that anomalous diffusion found in SPT data result from weak and transient interactions with dynamic nuclear substructures, and that SPT data analysis would benefit from a better description of such structures.

AB The analysis of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) response of electrodes and interfaces in terms of a distribution function of relaxation times (DFRT) has become an important topic of basic and applied research. For systems such as oxide films, passive layers, inhibitors, coatings and biological tissues, that distribution may arise as a consequence of normal-to-surface distributions of physical properties such as the electrical resistivity. The aim of this work is to relate the frequency response of those systems to the statistical properties of the distribution function, focusing on frequency dispersion behavior. The theory presented here is successfully applied to well-known models widely employed in the literature to interpret frequency dispersion in films (Young model, CPE behavior and ZARC response), but the analysis is also successful in predicting the response from arbitrary distributions such as the lognormal, Weibull and Cauchy distributions. The results apply mainly to the asymptotic frequency behavior. It is also shown that when the range of values of the distributed property is bounded, then there appear two critical frequencies at which a crossover from frequency dispersion towards ideal response takes place.

AB Current environmental, social and economic sustainability challenges are increasingly becoming sources of motivation for both manufacturing and service companies when attempting to innovate their businesses. In recent years, there has been growing interest from academics, policy-makers and practitioners on service innovation as a new business logic for companies to address societal challenges regarding sustainability. Nevertheless, research specifically focusing on service innovation in relation to sustain ability is scarce and ultimately scattered across different research fields. Thereby, only limited clues are available for companies willing to address sustainability challenges through service innovation. To encourage further research in this direction, this paper systematically reviewed the available literature by investigating peer-reviewed publications (from 2004 up to and including 2015) across different fields, which jointly focus on services, innovation and sustainability. The literature review confirmed both the growing amount of research on service innovation in relation to sustainability, as well as the lack of an overarching field to clearly identify such a phenomenon. The review also revealed that three main existing research streams (service innovation, product-service system and sustainability-oriented innovation) contribute to the investigation topic, though all have specific focuses when it comes to the sustainability and innovation dimensions considered. Taking stock of the descriptive and thematic analysis of the review and the identified research gaps, the paper concludes by discussing the need for a clear recognition of the emerging field of sustainability-oriented service innovation, and by outlining several future research pathways for its further enhancement.

AB Although high-altitude mountain habitats are often regarded as unfavorable for human occupation (e.g. Aldenderfer 2014); on the other hand tropical highlands in Africa are suggested as potential refugia during times of environmental stress (e.g. Basell 2008; Brandt et al. 2012). Archaeological investigations on Mount Damota (2908 m a.s.l.), located on the boundary between the Southwest Ethiopian Highlands to the west and the southern Main Ethiopian Rift valley to the east, yielded a large number of archaeological sites from the Middle Stone Age period until historical times. In this paper we try to reconstruct settlement models for the late Pleistocene and Holocene occupation in this area and speculate about potential land use patterns. Such complex topics demand a landscape archaeological approach that includes open-air sites and rock-shelters. The results from our excavations at Mochena Borago Rock-shelter and evidence from open-air-sites that were recorded during intensive surveys on the slopes and plateau of the mountain, allow a first reconstruction of the settlement history of the area.

AB The Review summarizes much of particle physics and cosmology. Using data from previous editions, plus 2,873 new measurements from 758 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 118 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on Neutrinos in Cosmology.
   Starting with this edition, the Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and all review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings. Review articles that were previously part of the Listings are now included in volume 1.
   The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (http://pdg.1b1.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is also available.

AB Extensins are cell wall glycoproteins, belonging to the hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein (HRGP) family, which are involved in many biological functions, including plant growth and defence. Several reviews have described the involvement of HRGPs in plant immunity but little focus has been given specifically to cell wall extensins. Yet, a large set of recently published data indicates that extensins play an important role in plant protection, especially in root-microbe interactions. Here, we summarise the current knowledge on this topic and discuss the importance of extensins in root defence. We first provide an overview of the distribution of extensin epitopes recognised by different monoclonal antibodies among plants and discuss the relevance of some of these epitopes as markers of the root defence response. We also highlight the implication of extensins in different types of plant interactions elicited by either pathogenic or beneficial micro-organisms. We then present and discuss the specific importance of extensins in root secretions, as these glycoproteins are not only found in the cell walls but are also released into the root mucilage. Finally, we propose a model to illustrate the impact of cell wall extensin on root secretions.

TI Agent-based models of malaria transmission: a systematic review

   IMPACT
AB Background: Much of the extensive research regarding transmission of malaria is underpinned by mathematical modelling. Compartmental models, which focus on interactions and transitions between population strata, have been a mainstay of such modelling for more than a century. However, modellers are increasingly adopting agent-based approaches, which model hosts, vectors and/or their interactions on an individual level. One reason for the increasing popularity of such models is their potential to provide enhanced realism by allowing system-level behaviours to emerge as a consequence of accumulated individual-level interactions, as occurs in real populations.
   Methods: A systematic review of 90 articles published between 1998 and May 2018 was performed, characterizing agent-based models (ABMs) relevant to malaria transmission. The review provides an overview of approaches used to date, determines the advantages of these approaches, and proposes ideas for progressing the field.
   Results: The rationale for ABM use over other modelling approaches centres around three points: the need to accurately represent increased stochasticity in low-transmission settings; the benefits of high-resolution spatial simulations; and heterogeneities in drug and vaccine efficacies due to individual patient characteristics. The success of these approaches provides avenues for further exploration of agent-based techniques for modelling malaria transmission. Potential extensions include varying elimination strategies across spatial landscapes, extending the size of spatial models, incorporating human movement dynamics, and developing increasingly comprehensive parameter estimation and optimization techniques.
   Conclusion: Collectively, the literature covers an extensive array of topics, including the full spectrum of transmission and intervention regimes. Bringing these elements together under a common framework may enhance knowledge of, and guide policies towards, malaria elimination. However, because of the diversity of available models, endorsing a standardized approach to ABM implementation may not be possible. Instead it is recommended that model frameworks be contextually appropriate and sufficiently described. One key recommendation is to develop enhanced parameter estimation and optimization techniques. Extensions of current techniques will provide the robust results required to enhance current elimination efforts.

AB Palliative care is patient and family-centered care that optimizes quality of life by anticipating, preventing, and treating suffering when "curative" therapies are futile. In the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), critically ill patients receive life-sustaining therapies with the goal of restoring or maintaining organ function. Palliative Care in the ICU is a widely discussed topic and it is increasingly applied in clinics. It encompasses symptoms control and end-of-life management, communication with relatives and setting goals of care ensuring dignity in death and decision-making power. However, effective application of Palliative Care in ICU presupposes specific knowledge and training which anesthesiologists and critical care physicians may lack. Moreover, logistic issues such protocols for patients' selection, application models and triggers for consultation of external experts are still matter of debate.
   The aim of this review is to provide the anesthesiologists and intensivists an overview of the aims, current evidence and practical advices about the application of palliative care in ICU.

AB Sustainable supply chain management is the improved level of management through the integration of environmental and social issues in parallel to the economic issues. It has emerged as a growing subject that now receives increasing interest from practitioners and academicians. Limited attempts have been made to take a broader look at the overall issues that form the core topics of this type of supply chain. In fact, there have been many exclusive studies that investigated the impact of inadvertent or unavoidable costs of supply chain processes. Exergy analysis is a powerful thermodynamic tool that may be employed to analyze and identify the inefficiencies in a process or a system. It has also been extended to efficiently evaluate how sustainable an industrial system, process or product is. This paper introduces exergetic models that compute and compare the consumed exergy for two coordination policies. It, also, evaluates the consumed exergy when producing/ordering locally versus globally. It recognizes the importance of financial, social and environmental aspects of choosing the more sustainable destination to produce and distribute a product. Numerical examples are presented and discussed to provide some insights for managers and decision-makers to select between domestic policies based on the consumed exergy and the monetary cost. Results show that societies can gain more from less consumed exergy and firms can save on some costs when producing/ordering domestically. This paper recommends to governments and other stakeholders to take actions that are effective in making societies consume resources wisely. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In hot humid climates, a major portion of air conditioning energy is used for dehumidification. In traditional centralized air conditioning systems, air is cooled below the dew point to remove the moisture. This process is energy intensive. Liquid desiccant dehumidification systems (LDDS) provide a promising alternative as they use low grade or free energy like solar energy. Majority of the existing direct-contact liquid desiccant dehumidification modules adopt the concept of low influx rates which ensures high residence time resulting in improved dehumidifier performance. There is limited knowledge with respect to high influx rates which is the topic of this paper. The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of a high-influx, bubble dehumidifier. A prototype dehumidifier employing aqueous Lithium Chloride (LiCl) as desiccant that could accommodate high-influx rates was developed and experiments were conducted to evaluate its performance. Results of the experiments are analyzed in terms of performance parameters namely moisture removal rate (MRR) and dehumidifier effectiveness. The apparatus could achieve a maximum MRR of 0.28 g/s resulting in 66% dehumidifier effectiveness. Empirical equations to predict the MRR were developed through linear regression using experimental data. The input variables used in regression are the inlet depth, the inlet air vapor pressure, the desiccant solution vapor pressure and the diffusion coefficient of water in LiCl solution, along with the design parameters. The diffusion coefficient parameter which was ignored in other dehumidifier models was found to be imperative in this research. The developed empirical equations were validated by comparing the predicted and measured values on a new set of experiments, the data for which were not used for regression.

AB We develop novel parallel algorithms that allow molecular dynamics simulations in which byproduct molecules are created and removed because of the chemical reactions during the molecular dynamics simulation. To prevent large increases in the potential energy, we introduce the byproduct molecules smoothly by changing the non-bonded interactions gradually. To simulate complete equilibrium reactions, we allow the byproduct molecules attack and destroy created bonds. Modeling of such reactions are, for instance, important to study the pore formation due to the presence of e.g. water molecules or development of polymer morphology during the process of splitting off byproduct molecules. Another concept that could be studied is the degradation of polymeric materials, a very important topic in a recycling of polymer waste. We illustrate the method by simulating the polymerization of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at the coarse-grained level as an example of a polycondensation reaction with water as a byproduct. The algorithms are implemented in a publicly available software package and are easily accessible using a domain-specific language that describes chemical reactions in an input configuration file.

AB Background: Right ventricular (RV) adaptation to acute and chronic pulmonary hypertensive syndromes is a significant determinant of short- and long-term outcomes. Although remarkable progress has been made in the understanding of RV function and failure since the meeting of the NIH Working Group on Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Right Heart Failure in 2005, significant gaps remain at many levels in the understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms of RV responses to pressure and volume overload, in the validation of diagnostic modalities, and in the development of evidence-based therapies.
   Methods: A multidisciplinary working group of 20 international experts from the American Thoracic Society Assemblies on Pulmonary Circulation and Critical Care, as well as external content experts, reviewed the literature, identified important knowledge gaps, and provided recommendations.
   Results: This Executive Summary includes key recommendations and provides a prioritized pathway for addressing pertinent preclinical and clinical research gaps. The group identified knowledge gaps and research opportunities in three major topic areas: 1) optimizing the methodology to assess RV function in acute and chronic conditions in preclinical models, human studies, and clinical trials; 2) analyzing advanced RV hemodynamic parameters at rest and in response to exercise; and 3) deciphering the underlying molecular and pathogenic mechanisms of RV function and failure in diverse PH syndromes.
   Conclusions: This statement provides a roadmap to further advance the state of knowledge, with the ultimate goal of developing RV-targeted therapies for patients with RV failure of any etiology.

AB The rising demand for sustainable energy and the availability of abundant wastes have stimulated research efforts around the world. As a newly emerging energy-based technology, microbial fuel cell (MFC) has received a significant attention due to its broad range of applications. Therefore, understanding the topics of interest and broadening collaboration networks are necessary to advance the research development towards integrated efforts. In this bibliometric study, our aim was to evaluate the global research trends in MFC area based on publication outputs, co-authorships among authors and affiliated countries, and co-occurrences of author keywords. Using the Scopus database, a total of 4126 journal articles published between 1962-2017 were retrieved. Results have shown that since 2008, the number of publications increased by 100 articles every two years, resulting in the steady increase in the cumulative total publications until present. About 60% of the global total publications were contributed by researchers from China and USA, leading the other 70 countries/territories. Also, among the most productive university from each of the 15 leading countries, four were amongst the world's top 100 universities. In conclusion, recent progress in MFC research includes the following (but not limited to) (i) electrode materials incorporated nanotechnology, ceramic, and biochar; (ii) mathematical modeling (e.g. artificial neural network); and (iii) economic assessment and life cycle analysis.

AB In spite of its major role on the atmospheric volatile budget, climate, and tracking magmatic transfers, mantle (CO2) degassing below volcanoes is still poorly understood. Most of the studies on this scientific topic lack constraint on the CO2 concentration of primary melts, the depth at which it starts degassing, and the extent of this process in the mantle. In this study of Piton de la Fournaise (PdF) volcano, we couple geochemistry of low solubility gases (He, Ar, CO2, delta C-13) in fluid inclusions (FIs) and petro-chemistry of magmatic inclusions on a set of olivine and clinopyroxene crystals from basalts and ultramafic enclaves.
   We constrain basaltic melt degassing at PdF over a large pressure range (from 4 GPa up to the surface). Based on CO2-He-Ar systematics, we infer that extensive degassing occurs already in the upper mantle (4-1 GPa) and it is favored by multiple steps of magma ponding and differentiation up to the mantle-crust underplating depth (0.4 GPa). Thus, we calculate that basaltic melts injected at crustal depth (<0.4 GPa) have already exsolved similar to 94 +/- 5 wt% of their primary CO2 content in accordance with (1) the evolved and degassed signature of erupted lavas and (2) the weakness of inter-eruptive gas emissions in the active area bearing low-temperature vapor-dominated fumaroles. Our results at PdF strongly contrast with previous findings on other ocean island volcanoes having a higher magma production rate and faster magma ascent, like Kilauea (Hawaii), whose basalts experience only limited extent of differentiation and degassing. We propose that extensive degassing already in the upper mantle can be a common process for many volcanoes of the Earth and is tightly dependent on the dynamics of magma ascent and differentiation across multiple ponding zones.
   Based on the modeling developed in this study, we propose a new estimation of the CO2 content (up to 3.5 +/- 1.4 wt%) in primary basaltic melts at PdF leading to a carbon content in the mantle source of 716 +/- 525 ppm. This new estimation is considerably higher than the few previous calculations performed for Ocean Island Basalts (OIB) systems. Another implication of this work involves the possible bias between the delta C-13 measured in volcanic gas emissions (<-6 parts per thousand) and that of primary vapour phase (-0.5 +/- 0.5%c) constrained in this work. This bias would confirm the early step of extensive CO2 degassing within the upper mantle and could represent an alternative for the hypotheses of carbon recycling or mantle heterogeneity in support of the low delta C-13 signature of some mantle reservoirs. This study bears significant implications on the global budget of volcanic volatile emissions, chiefly regarding the contribution of past and future emissions of volcanic CO2 to climate dynamics, and on volcanic gas monitoring.

AB A number of factors in Western society, including inflammatory diets, sedentary lifestyles, vitamin D deficiency and chronic psychological stress, are known to induce inflammation and to be associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. One factor that is emerging as a potential inflammation inducing factor is biota depletion, or loss of biodiversity from the ecosystem of the human body as a result of industrialization. Originally known as the "hygiene hypothesis", biota alteration theory describes the effects of biota alteration on the human immune system. Work on this topic has pinpointed depletion of helminths as a key loss to the body's ecosystem in Western society, and suggests that some exposure to helminths, ubiquitous prior to the modern era, may be necessary for normal immune system development. Sociomedical studies of humans "self-treating" with helminths as well as limited studies in animal models strongly suggest that helminth therapy may be a productive approach toward treating a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, including chronic fatigue, migraine headaches, depression and anxiety disorders. However, helminth therapy faces some daunting hurdles, including the lack of a financial incentive for development, despite a tremendous potential market for the organisms. It is argued that benevolent donation for early trials as well as changes in regulatory policy to accommodate helminth therapy may be important for the field to develop. It is hoped that future success with some high-profile trials can propel the field, now dominated more by self-treatment than by clinical trials, forward into the main stream of medicine.

AB The search for multivariate quadrature rules of minimal size with a specified polynomial accuracy has been the topic of many years of research. Finding such a rule allows accurate integration of moments, which play a central role in many aspects of scientific computing with complex models. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we provide novel mathematical analysis of the polynomial quadrature problem that provides a lower bound for the minimal possible number of nodes in a polynomial rule with specified accuracy. We give concrete but simplistic multivariate examples where a minimal quadrature rule can be designed that achieves this lower bound, along with situations that showcase when it is not possible to achieve this lower bound. Our second contribution is the formulation of an algorithm that is able to efficiently generate multivariate quadrature rules with positive weights on non-tensorial domains. Our tests show success of this procedure in up to 20 dimensions. We test our method on applications to dimension reduction and chemical kinetics problems, including comparisons against popular alternatives such as sparse grids, Monte Carlo and quasi Monte Carlo sequences, and Stroud rules. The quadrature rules computed in this paper outperform these alternatives in almost all scenarios. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A multidisciplinary approach is presented to analyse the precipitation process in a model Al-Cu alloy. Although this topic has been extensively studied in the past, most of the investigations are focussed either on transmission electron microscopy or on thermal analysis of the processes. The information obtained from these techniques cannot, however, provide a coherent picture of all the complex transformations that take place during decomposition of supersaturated solid solution. Thermal analysis, high resolution dilatometry, (high resolution) transmission electron microscopy and density functional calculations are combined to study precipitation kinetics, interfacial energies, and the effect of second phase precipitates on the mechanical strength of the alloy. Data on both the coherent and semi-coherent orientations of the theta ''/Al interface are reported for the first time. The combination of the different characterization and modelling techniques provides a detailed picture of the precipitation phenomena that take place during aging and of the different contributions to the strength of the alloy. This strategy can be used to analyse and design more complex alloys. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Future urban development and climatic changes are likely to affect hydrologic regimes in many watersheds. Quantifying potential water regime changes caused by these stressors is therefore crucial for enabling decision makers to develop viable environmental management strategies. This study presents an approach that integrates mid-21st century impervious surface growth estimates derived from the Imperviousness Change Analysis Tool with downscaled climate model projections and a hydrologic model Soil and Water Assessment Tool to characterize potential water regime changes in a mixed-use watershed in central Missouri, USA. Results for the climate change only scenario showed annual streamflow and runoff decreases (-10.7% and -9.2%) and evapotranspiration increases (+6.8%), while results from the urbanization only scenario showed streamflow and runoff increases (+3.8% and +9.3%) and evapotranspiration decreases (-2.4%). Results for the combined impacts scenario suggested that climatic changes could have a larger impact than urbanization on annual streamflow, (overall decrease of -6.1%), and could largely negate surface runoff increases caused by urbanization. For the same scenario, climatic changes exerted a stronger influence on annual evapotranspiration than urbanization (+3.9%). Seasonal results indicated that the relative influences of urbanization and climatic changes vary seasonally. Climatic changes most greatly influenced streamflow and runoff during winter and summer, and evapotranspiration during summer. During some seasons the directional change for hydrologic processes matched for both stressors. This work presented a practicable approach for investigating the relative influences of mid-21st century urbanization and climatic changes on the hydrology of a representative mixed-use watershed, adding to a limited body of research on this topic. This was done using a transferrable approach that can be adapted for watersheds in other regions.

AB Social image annotation, which aims at inferring a set of semantic concepts for a social image, is an effective and straightforward way to facilitate social image search. Conventional approaches mainly demonstrated on adopting the visual features and tags, without considering other types of metadata. How to enhance the accuracy of social image annotation by fully exploiting multi-modal features is still an opening and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an improved Multi-Modal Data Fusion based Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model (MMDF-LDA) to annotate social images via fusing visual content, user-supplied tags, user comments, and geographic information. When MMDF-LDA samples annotations for one data modality, all the other data modalities are exploited. In MMDF-LDA, geographical topics are generated from GPS locations of social images, and annotations have different probability to be used in different geographical regions. A social image is divided into several patches in advance, and then MMDF-LDA assigns annotations for the patches of social images by estimating the probability of annotation-patch assignment. Through experiments in social image annotation and retrieval on several datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MMDF-LDA model in comparison with stateof-the-art methods.

TI Adapting the Quality Maternal and Newborn Care (QMNC) Framework to
   evaluate models of antenatal care: A pilot study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MIDWIFERY
AB Background
   Recent evidence indicates that continuity models of maternity care result in improved clinical and psychosocial outcomes, but their causal mechanisms are poorly understood. The recent Lancet Series on Midwifery's Quality Maternal and Newborn Care Framework describes five components of quality care and their associated characteristics. As an initial step in developing this Framework into an evaluation toolkit, we transformed its components and characteristics into a topic guide to assess stakeholder perceptions and experiences of care provided and received. The main purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of this process.
   Methods
   We conducted twelve focus groups in two Scottish health board areas with 13 pregnant women, 18 new mothers, 26 midwives and 12 obstetricians who had experience of a range of different models of maternity care. Transcripts were analysed using a six-phase approach of thematic analysis. We mapped the identified themes and sub-themes back to the Framework.
   Results
   The emerging themes and sub-themes demonstrated the feasibility of using the QMNC framework as a data collection tool, and as a lens for analysing the data. Of the four emerging themes, only Organisation Culture / Work Structure' mapped directly to a single Framework component. The others-'Relationships'; 'Information and support'; and 'Uncertainty'-mapped to between two and five components, illustrating the interconnectedness of the Framework's components. Some negative sub-themes mirrored positive Framework characteristics of care. Some re-phrasing and re-ordering of the topic guides in later focus groups ensured we could cover all aspects of the Framework adequately.
   Conclusion Adapting the Quality Maternal and Newborn Care Framework enabled us to focus on aspects of care which worked well and which didn't work well for these key stakeholders. Identifying 'what works for whom and why' in different models of care is a necessary step in reinforcing and replicating the most effective models of care.

AB Body fluid regulation, or osmoregulation, continues to be a major topic in comparative physiology, and teleost fishes have been the subject of intensive research. Great progress has been made in understanding the osmoregulatory mechanisms including drinking behavior in teleosts and mammals. Mudskipper gobies can bridge the gap from aquatic to terrestrial habitats by their amphibious behavior, but the studies are yet emerging. In this review, we introduce this unique teleost as a model to study osmoregulatory behaviors, particularly amphibious behaviors regulated by the central action of hormones. Regarding drinking behavior of mammals, a thirst sensation is aroused by angiotensin II (Ang II) through direct actions on the forebrain circumventricular structures, which predominantly motivates them to search for water and take it into the mouth for drinking. By contrast, aquatic teleosts can drink water that is constantly present in their mouth only by reflex swallowing, and Ang II induces swallowing by acting on the hindbrain circumventricular organ without inducing thirst. In mudskippers, however, through the loss of buccal water by swallowing, which appears to induce buccal drying on land, Ang II motivates these fishes to move to water for drinking. Thus, mudskippers revealed a unique thirst regulation by sensory detection in the buccal cavity. In addition, the neurohypophysial hormones, isotocin (IT) and vasotocin (VT), promote migration to water via IT receptors in mudskippers. VT is also dipsogenic and the neurons in the forebrain may mediate their thirst. VT regulates social behaviors as well as osmoregulation. The VT-induced migration appears to be a submissive response of subordinate mudskippers to escape from competitive and dehydrating land. Together with implications of VT in aggression, mudskippers may bridge the multiple functions of neurohypophysial hormones. Interestingly, cortisol, an important hormone for seawater adaptation and stress response in teleosts, also stimulates the migration toward water, mediated possibly via the mineralocorticoid receptor. The corticosteroid system that is responsive to external stressors can accelerate emergence of migration to alternative habitats. In this review, we suggest this unique teleost as an important model to deepen insights into the behavioral roles of these hormones in relation to osmoregulation.

AB Since its foundation in 2005, YouTube, which is considered to be the largest video sharing site, has undergone substantial changes. Over the last decade, the platform developed into a leading marketing tool used for product promotion by social media influencers. Past research indicates that these influencers are regarded as opinion leaders and cooperate with brands to market products on YouTube through electronic-word-of-mouth mechanisms. However, surprisingly little is known about the magnitude of this phenomenon. In our article, we make a first attempt to quantify product promotion and use an original dataset of 139,475 videos created by German YouTube channels between 2009 and 2017. Applying methods for automated content analysis, we find that YouTube users indeed are confronted with an ever-growing share of product promotion, particularly in the beauty and fashion sector. Our findings fuel concerns regarding the social and economic impact of influencers, especially on younger target groups.

AB Background: Systematic literature searching is recognised as a critical component of the systematic review process. It involves a systematic search for studies and aims for a transparent report of study identification, leaving readers clear about what was done to identify studies, and how the findings of the review are situated in the relevant evidence. Information specialists and review teams appear to work from a shared and tacit model of the literature search process. How this tacit model has developed and evolved is unclear, and it has not been explicitly examined before.
   The purpose of this review is to determine if a shared model of the literature searching process can be detected across systematic review guidance documents and, if so, how this process is reported in the guidance and supported by published studies.
   Method: A literature review.
   Two types of literature were reviewed: guidance and published studies. Nine guidance documents were identified, including: The Cochrane and Campbell Handbooks. Published studies were identified through 'pearl growing', citation chasing, a search of PubMed using the systematic review methods filter, and the authors' topic knowledge.
   The relevant sections within each guidance document were then read and re-read, with the aim of determining key methodological stages. Methodological stages were identified and defined. This data was reviewed to identify agreements and areas of unique guidance between guidance documents. Consensus across multiple guidance documents was used to inform selection of 'key stages' in the process of literature searching.
   Results: Eight key stages were determined relating specifically to literature searching in systematic reviews. They were: who should literature search, aims and purpose of literature searching, preparation, the search strategy, searching databases, supplementary searching, managing references and reporting the search process.
   Conclusions: Eight key stages to the process of literature searching in systematic reviews were identified. These key stages are consistently reported in the nine guidance documents, suggesting consensus on the key stages of literature searching, and therefore the process of literature searching as a whole, in systematic reviews. Further research to determine the suitability of using the same process of literature searching for all types of systematic review is indicated.

AB The ongoing challenge of maintaining and improving the quality of water that leaves urban stormwater systems is often addressed using technical rather than social solutions. The need for investment in often expensive water infrastructure can be reduced through better investing in promoting human behaviors that protect water quality as part of water-sensitive urban design (WSUD) initiatives. Successfully achieving this requires understanding factors that influence adoption of proenvironmental behaviors. We review past studies examining this topic and identify that factors influencing adoption of proenvironmental behaviors relevant to WSUD commonly fall into four domains: proenvironmental values and norms, awareness and knowledge of environmental problems and the actions that can address them, proximity and place-based identity, and life-stage and lifestyle factors. We propose the VAIL (values, awareness, identify, lifestyle) framework, based on these four domains and able to be contextualized to specific water-quality problems and individual communities, to assist in diagnosing factors influencing adoption of proenvironmental behaviors. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework in a case study examining adoption of gardening practices that support water quality in Canberra, Australia. We developed 22 locally relevant VAIL indicators and surveyed 3,334 residents to understand engagement in four water-friendly gardening behaviors that help improve water quality in local lakes. In regression modeling, the indicators explained a significant amount of variance in these behaviors and suggested avenues for supporting greater adoption of these behaviors. Predictor variables across all four VAIL domains were significant, highlighting the importance of a multidomain framework.

AB Telomeres shorten with age, the major risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (aCVD). The observation of shorter telomeres in aCVD patients thus suggested that critical telomere shortening may contribute to premature biological aging and aCVD. Therefore, telomere length often is suggested as a causal aCVD risk factor, a proposal supported by recent Mendelian randomization studies; however, epidemiological research has shown disappointingly low effect sizes. It therefore remains uncertain whether telomere shortening is a cause of aCVD or merely a consequence. The authors argue that elucidating the mechanistic foundation of these findings is essential for any possible translation of telomere biology to the clinic. Here, they critically evaluate evidence for causality in animal models and human studies, and review popular hypotheses and discuss their clinical implications. The authors identify 4 key questions that any successful mechanistic theory should address, and they discuss how atherosclerosis-associated local telomere attrition may provide the answers.

AB Introduction. Knowledge Translation (KT) is expected to be a critical learning outcome of a Continuing Professional Development (CPD) program. It continues to serve as an area of interest among educators and healthcare providers due to its importance to evidence-based practice. This study endeavored to develop a valid and reliable KT learning assessment tool in CPD.
   Methods. The Inventory of Reflective Vignettes (IRV), an innovative approach of integrating research vignettes, was utilized in crafting the 20-item IRV-KT tool. This instrument includes knowledge creation and action as essential KT constructs. KT competency was assessed in three segments (i.e., before and after CPD event and if in a lecture) using a one-group post-posttest pre-experimental design. Health professionals who successfully completed a CPD program on a knowledge translation topic were asked to complete the IRV-KT during the pilot study (n = 10) and actual implementation (n = 45). Responses were subjected to Cronbach's reliability and criterion-validity testing.
   Results. The initial test of the IRV-KT tool demonstrated a high internal reliability (alpha = 0.97) and most items yielded acceptable validity scores. During the actual implementation, a higher reliability score of 0.98 was generated with significant correlations between the before-after segments for both KT constructs of creation (r = 0.33, p < 0.05) and action (r = 0.49, p < 0.05). All items have significant positive validity coefficients (r > 0.35, p < 0.05) in all segments of the tool.
   Discussion. The study produced a reflective assessment tool to validly and reliably assess KT learning in a CPD. IRV-KT is seen to guide the curriculum process of CPD programs to bridge learning and healthcare outcomes.

AB Background: Pain is an important health problem adversely affecting functionality and quality of life. Though self-rated health (SRH) is a major predictor of mortality, its relationship with pain is not well understood. We explore 1) how pain and age interact to influence SRH, and 2) provincial variations in SRH across Canada.
   Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from Statistics Canada's Canadian Community Health Survey-Healthy Aging (n = 30,685), which targeted those 45 years and older and was conducted from 2008 to 12-01 to 2009-11-30. The response rate was 74.4%. The topics covered included socio-demographics, well-being and chronic diseases. We performed both bivariate and multivariate analyses between each predictor and SRH; unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are reported. Two-level logistic regression mixed model was used to account for provincial differences. An intraclass correlation coefficient was also computed.
   Results: Slightly more than half of respondents (56.40%) were female. In bivariate analyses, those experiencing pain had an odds ratio of 0.20. Which means that the odds of reporting good self-rated health are 4 to 5 times lower for those with pain, compare to the odds of reporting good self-rated health among those without pain (p < 0.001). In multivariate analyses the highly educated, female gender, the never married or single and households with high yearly income were predictors of good health (p < 0.001). Those who reported depressive symptoms, the lonely, the obese, daily smokers and/or the stressed were less likely to rate their health as good (p < 0.001). The influence of pain on SRH was stronger among younger age groups (45-54 years) compared to older age groups (75-84 years, with an odds ratio of 3.53 [p < 0.001] versus 3.14 [p < 0.001]).
   Conclusions: Pain, among other determinants, is associated with SRH. Individuals in rating their health may consider a variety of factors, some of which may not be apparent to health providers. We found that those who reported depressive symptoms, were daily smokers, the obese, the lonely, and/or having a stressful life were less likely to rate their health as good. No significant provincial variations in SRH in Canada was observed in this study.

AB This study examines a way to promote civility in online political discussions through modeling discursive cues. An online experiment (N=321) was conducted to investigate the impact of civil and uncivil discursive cues on participants' mode of discussion. Results show that participants who were exposed to civil cues were more likely to engage in civil discourse themselves, stay on-topic, and offer additional perspectives in their comments. We also found that metacommunication (i.e., talking about the tone of discussion) engendered more metacommunication. This study illustrates the impact of modeling discursive cues and illuminates the possibility that participants in online discussion can improve their discursive environment.

AB The study of the chemical evolution of glycine in the interstellar medium is one of the challenging topics in astrochemistry. Here we present the chemical modeling of glycine in hot cores using the state-of-the-art three-phase chemical model NAUTILUS, which is focused on the latest glycine chemistry. For the formation process of glycine on the grain surface, we obtained consistent results with previous studies that glycine would be formed via the reactions of COOH with CH2NH2. However, we will report three important findings regarding the chemical evolution and the detectability of interstellar glycine. First, with the experimentally obtained binding energy from the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiment, a large proportion of glycine was destroyed through the grain surface reactions with NH or CH3O radicals before it fully evaporated. As a result, the formation process in the gas phase is more important than thermal evaporation from grains. If this is the case, NH2OH and CH3COOH rather than CH3NH2 and CH2NH would be the essential precursors to the gas-phase glycine. Second, since the gas-phase glycine will be quickly destroyed by positive ions or radicals, the early evolutionary phase of the hot cores would be the preferable target for the future glycine surveys. Third, we suggest the possibility that the suprathermal hydrogen atoms can strongly accelerate the formation of COOH radicals from CO2, resulting in the dramatic increase of formation rate of glycine on grains. The efficiency of this process should be investigated in detail by theoretical and experimental studies in the future.

AB A novel shape evolution in the Sn isotopes by the state-of-the-art application of the Monte Carlo shell model calculations is presented in a unified way for the Sn100-138 isotopes. A large model space consisting of eight single-particle orbits for protons and neutrons is taken with the fixed Hamiltonian and effective charges, where protons in the 1g(9/2) orbital are fully activated. While the significant increase of the B(E2; 0(1)(+) -> 2(1)(+)) value, seen around Sn-110 as a function of neutron number (N), has remained a major puzzle over decades, it is explained as a consequence of the shape evolution driven by proton excitations from the 1g(9/2) orbital. A second-order quantum phase transition is found around N = 66, connecting the phase of such deformed shapes to the spherical pairing phase. The shape and shell evolutions are thus described, covering topics from the Gamow-Teller decay of Sn-100 to the enhanced double magicity of Sn-132.

AB Social network analysis is an interdisciplinary topic attracting researchers from biology, economics, psychology, and machine learning, with an existing long history based on graph theory. It has since attracted interests from both the research and business communities for a strong potential and variety of applications. In addition, this interest has been fueled by the large success of online social networking sites and the subsequent abundance of social network data produced. An important aspect in this research field is influence maximization in social networks. The goal is to find a set of individuals to be targeted with the aim to drive social contagion and generate a diffusion cascade. We provide here an overview of the models and approaches used to analyze social networks. In this context, we also discuss data preparation and privacy concerns. We further describe different kind of approaches based on centrality measures, which express a sociological interpretation of the data, and stochastic influence and information propagation techniques, which aim at modeling the underlying diffusion processes that govern social interactions.

AB Water purification using microbubbles has become an important topic, owing to its enhanced mass transfer effect. Therefore, a full 3D numerical model is developed for wastewater purification using microbubbles with bacterial biochemical reactions. Microbubbles are injected into the bioreactor, and the oxygen obtained from microbubble dissolution is used by the bacteria for substrate consumption. This consumption performance may depend on several factors, including physical parameters such as bubble size, column height, and injection type. Optimization of the bioreactor performance based on these parameters would lead to significantly faster purification. In this study, the dependences of these parameters are investigated numerically. The bioreactor model is provided by the mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation for fluid flow and bubble motion tracking in the system. Mass transfer, gas dissolution, and mixing using the Sherwood number approach are employed in this model. Biochemical reactions based on various literatures, including activated sludge models, are used for the current simulation of wastewater purification. Simulations are carried out for an aerobic bacterial system with carbohydrates as the chemical oxygen demand source. The bioreactor height is varied from 1.1 to 4.1 to the base (similar to 0.1 m), the bubble size is varied from 200 mu m to 1 mm, and the central and uniform injection systems are compared. The analysis demonstrates that, for microbubbles with a uniform injection system, a drastic reduction in bioreactor height can be achieved without a performance reduction. An important conclusion is that, for a shorter bioreactor height with 200 mu m-microbubble injections, the uniform injection system offers significantly superior performance, while for a longer height with larger (500 mu m or 1 mm) bubbles, the central and uniform injections provide nearly the same performance.

AB In order to overcome the brittle fracture characteristics of polyamides, the study on high efficiency toughening of polyamides is always a hot topic. In this article, n-ethyl-p-toluene sulfonamide (N-PTSA) was used as the toughening agent in polyamide 6 (PA6) matrix. The PA6/N-PTSA composites were prepared by melt compounding method. The PA6 composites were analyzed systematically from aspects of mechanical properties, thermal properties, crystal structures, and hydrogen bonds. There existed an obvious toughening effect in PA6 composite with the addition of 7 wt % of N-PTSA. Meanwhile, the tensile strength of the composite was not reduced. The addition of N-PTSA induced the formation of -form crystals, higher crystallinities and lower density of hydrogen bonds in the composites, which was beneficial to improvement of the mechanical properties. Based on the above results, the molecular structure model of toughening mechanism of N-PTSA in PA6 was established. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2018, 135, 46527.

AB We review state-of-the-art electronic structure methods based both on wave function theory (WFT) and density functional theory (DFT). Strengths and limitations of both the wave function and density functional based approaches are discussed, and modern attempts to combine these two methods are presented. The challenges in modeling excited-state chemistry using both single-reference and multireference methods are described. Topics covered include background, combining density functional theory with single-configuration wave function theory, generalized Kohn-Sham (KS) theory, global hybrids, range-separated hybrids, local hybrids, using KS orbitals in many-body theory (including calculations of the self-energy and the GW approximation), Bethe-Salpeter equation, algorithms to accelerate GW calculations, combining DFT with multiconfigurational WFT, orbital-dependent correlation functionals based on multiconfigurational WFT, building multiconfigurational wave functions from KS configurations, adding correlation functionals to multiconfiguration self-consistent-field (MCSCF) energies, combining DFT with configuration-interaction singles by means of time-dependent DFT, using range separation to combine DFT with MCSCF, embedding multiconfigurational WFT in DFT, and multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory.

AB The question of what determines divergence both between and within species has been the central topic in evolutionary biology. Neutral drift and environmentally dependent divergence are predicted to play roles in driving population and lineage divergence. However, neutral drift may preclude adaptation if the rate of gene flow between populations is high. Here, we sampled populations of three Taiwania (Taiwania cryptomerioides) lineages occurring in Taiwan, the mainland of China (Yunnan-Myanmar border), and northern Vietnam, and tested the relative strength of neutral drift and divergent selection in shaping divergence of those populations and lineages. We quantified genetic and epigenetic variation, respectively, using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP). Analysis of 1413 AFLP and 462 MSAP loci using frequency-based genome scan methods and generalized linear models (GLMs) found no potential selective outliers when only Taiwanese populations were examined, suggesting that neutral drift was the predominant evolutionary process driving differentiation between those populations. However, environmentally associated divergence was found when lineages were compared. Thirty-two potential selective outliers were identified based on genome scans and their associations with environmental variables were tested with GLMs, generalized linear mixed effect models (GLMMs), and model selection with a model averaging approach. Ten loci (six AFLP and four MSAP) were found to be strongly associated with environmental variables, particularly monthly temperature variation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using model selection and a model averaging approach. Because only a small portion of genetic and epigenetic loci were found to be potential selective outliers, neutral evolutionary process might also have played crucial roles in driving lineage divergence, particularly between geographically and genetically isolated island and mainland Asia lineages. Nevertheless, the vast amount of neutral drift causing genetic and epigenetic variations might have the potential for adaptation to future climate changes. These could be important for the survival of Taiwania in different geographic areas.

AB Atomic layered two-dimensional (2D) materials have become fascinating research topics due to their intriguing performances, but the limitation of nonmagnetic properties hinders their further applications. Developing versatile strategies endowing 2D materials with ferromagnetism is one of the main trends in current research studies. Herein, a hydrogen plasma strategy is introduced to dope hydrogen (H) atoms into the prototypical layered alpha-MoO3 nanosheets, by which ferromagnetic and exchange bias (EB) effects can be induced by H atom doping into alpha-MoO3 to form HxMoO3. These effects were interpreted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We find that H atom doping can introduce unoccupied states and induce a net magnetic moment localized on the d orbital of the Mo atom, because of the generated asymmetric distribution of electronic states on the Mo atom near the Fermi level. Moreover, the saturation magnetization and the EB field (H-e) of hydrogenated alpha-MoO3 are found to be tunable through altering the amount of H dopant. This work provides new perspectives for the effective manipulation of ferromagnetism and exchange interaction through H doping. We hope that the presented hydrogenation strategy is applicable for other kinds of 2D materials.

AB With the rapid development of biological research, microRNAs (miRNA) have become an attractive topic because lots of experimental studies have revealed the significant associations between miRNAs and diseases. However, considering that experiments are expensive and time-consuming, computational methods for predicting associations between miRNAs and diseases have become increasingly crucial. In this study, we proposed a neighborhood regularized logistic matrix factorization method for miRNA-disease association prediction (NRLMFMDA) by integrating miRNA functional similarity, disease semantic similarity, Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity, and experimentally validation of disease-miRNA association. We used Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity to cover the shortage of the traditional similarity to make it more reasonable and complete. Furthermore, NRLMFMDA also considered the important influences of the neighborhood information and took full advantage of them to improve the accuracy of the miRNA-disease association prediction. We also improved the accuracy by giving higher weights to the known association data in the process of calculating the potential association probabilities. In the global and the local leave-one-out cross validation, NRLMFMDA got the AUCs of 0.9068 and 0.8239, respectively. Moreover, the average AUC of NRLMFMDA in 5-fold cross validation was 0.8976 +/- 0.0034. All the three kinds of cross validations have shown significant advantages to a number of previous models. In the case studies of breast neoplasms, esophageal neoplasms and lymphoma according to known miRNA-disease associations in the recent version of HMDD database, there were 78, 80, and 74% of top 50 predicted related miRNAs verified to have associations with these three diseases, respectively. In the further case studies for new disease without any known related miRNAs and the previous version of HMDD database, there were also high proportions of the predicted miRNAs verified by experimental reports. All the validation experiment results have demonstrated the effectiveness and practicability of NRLFMDA to predict the potential miRNA-disease associations.

TI Effectiveness of an intervention for managing victimization risks
   related to societal participation for persons with severe mental
   illness: a cluster RCT study protocol

AB Background: People with severe mental illness (SMI) are more likely to experience criminal victimization than other community members. In addition, (self-) stigma and perceived discrimination are highly prevalent in this group. These adversities in the social context often have major adverse effects on the rehabilitation and recovery of these persons. Current practice, however, lacks instruments to address these issues. As a reaction, the Victoria intervention was developed and pilot-tested with client representatives, professionals, trainers and researchers. The Victoria intervention is a method for community mental health care workers to expand their awareness of this topic and support them in assessing victimization and incorporate appropriate services, including trauma screening and rehabilitation services, in their health care planning. For clients, the Victoria intervention aims to increase their awareness, active management of possible victimization risks and promote safe social participation. As a new intervention, little is known about its use in real practice and its effects on client outcomes.
   Methods/design: To determine the feasibility and effectiveness of this intervention, a process evaluation and a first cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be carried out. Outpatients from eight Flexible Assertive Community Treatment (F-ACT) teams from two mental health care (MHC) organizations in the Netherlands are included in the study. Teams in the intervention group will receive three half-day training sessions, and bi-monthly supervision meetings for 18 months. Teams in the control group provide care as usual. For the process evaluation, a multi-method design is used. To assess effects on client outcomes, clients will be interviewed about their experiences on victimization and societal participation using validated questionnaires at baseline, and after 9 and 18 months.
   Discussion: This study is the first to evaluate an intervention aiming at recognition of victimization, (self-) stigma and perceived discrimination, and targeting outpatients' insights into possible risks and coping skills to tackle these risks to enhance safe societal participation. Results of this study may validate the Victoria intervention as a practice to better manage risk for adversities related to societal participation.

AB Ecosystems services (ES) assessment is a significant scientific topic recognized for its potential to address sustainability issues. However, there is an absence of science-policy frameworks in land use planning that lead to the ES science being used in policy. China's Ecological Redline Policy (ERP) is one of the first national policies utilizing multiple ES, but there is no standardized approach for working across the science-policy interface. We propose a transdisciplinary framework to determine ecological redline areas (ERAs) in Shanghai using: ES, biodiversity and ecologically fragile hotspots, landscape structure, and stakeholder opinions. We determine the five criteria to identify ERAs for Shanghai using multi-temporal, high resolution images (0.5 m) and biophysical models. We examine ERP effectiveness by comparing land use scenarios for 2040. Compared to alternative land uses, ES increase significantly under the ERP. The inclusion of ES in spatial planning led stake-holders to increase terrestrial habitat protection by 174% in Shanghai. Our analysis suggests that strategic planning for ES could reduce tradeoffs between environmental quality and development.

AB Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the main cell source for cell-based therapy. MSCs from articular cavity synovial fluid could potentially be used for cartilage tissue engineering. MSCs from synovial fluid (SF-MSCs) have been considered promising candidates for articular regeneration, and their potential therapeutic benefit has made them an important research topic of late. SF-MSCs from the knee cavity of the New Zealand white rabbit can be employed as an optimized translational model to assess human regenerative medicine. By means of CD90-based magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) technologies, this protocol successfully obtains rabbit SF-MSCs (rbSF-MSCs) from this rabbit model and further fully demonstrates the MSC phenotype of these cells by inducing them to differentiate to osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. Therefore, this approach can be applied in cell biology research and tissue engineering using simple equipment and procedures.

TI Mondragon Cooperative Experience: education cooperative as a process of
   social transformation
SO CIRIEC-ESPANA REVISTA DE ECONOMIA PUBLICA SOCIAL Y COOPERATIVA
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE Cooperativism; Education; Social transformation
AB The cooperativism is considered one of the main instruments of promotion of economic and social development that creates and distributes wealth and promotes social capital in the communities. The cooperative education in the development of competences attends to the proposals of territorial development materialized in programs and projects that begin to have meaning at the moment of its implementation. Even though the Mondragon Cooperative Experience arouses interest after six decades, this paper does not aim to analyze its history, achievements, contradictions, and challenges already analyzed and debated by literature. The objective is to analyze the proposals in the field of cooperative education as an enhancing factor in the articulation between productive and educational practices, it means, between reflection and action as a factor that intensifies the teaching-learning process for individual and social development. The proposal is based on a qualitative research, case study, and participant observation of the Cooperative Education Model of Mondragon, from an exploratory-descriptive-evaluative view that was carried out during a sandwich doctorate internship, in the years 2014-2015, resulting from the collaboration between two graduate programs of Brazilian universities-PUCPR and FURB - and the Institute of Cooperative Studies (Lanki) of Mondragon Unibertsitatea. To analyze the data was used the methodology of the Collective Subject Discourse (CSD) and the QualiQuantiSoft (R) software. The results show the cooperativism course of the Lanki: (1) Education processes are (re) construction and strengthening of the cooperative identity in three parts: rational-intellectual, emotional-affective and action. Lanki understands education as an integral and continuous process that encompasses the development of all dimensions of the person through interaction with their social environment. Understands education as a systematic and planned action that affects not only knowledge but also attitudes and abilities through the experience of learning in a specific context. (2) Ecological sustainability is a concern in this model but its reflection in practice is still far to become reality. Responsible consumption based on ecological, ethical, and social criteria, is at the level of reflection and not of action. The initiatives in this sense are still timid and incipient. The CSDs shows difficulties with the transmission of knowledge and competence within the cooperatives as well as to the application of the apprenticeship. The competencies for the implementation of learning are, therefore, more limited. The main points based on the qualitative reading of the evaluations obtained in the course are highlighted. The participants showed a high degree of interest. It is emphasized overall, that the topics studied are of vital importance for the development of the cooperative. There is a need to invigorate shared decision spaces to create a sense of belonging. Many of the participants acknowledge this feeling as such a certain "discovery". It is emphasized that these issues have not been properly worked on in the cooperatives and it is necessary to dedicate time to them. The dialogue generated among the participants and the methodology used is particularly valued. The cooperative course classes require more time. There is a clear demand to discuss cooperativism dynamics from the social bases of the cooperatives. The cooperative education should form, first of all, cooperative men and women and then form cooperatives leaderships.
   In this analysis, it is concluded that the pedagogy of social practice of cooperative education, despite having an interdisciplinary approach, has difficulties to advance from reflection to action, and from discourse to practice. The development model in which the Mondragon cooperatives are immersed is a factor that hinders progress towards the sustainability of the development model by focusing on the environmental-ecological axis. One of the main challenges of the educational model analyzed is promoting the abilities and competencies of individuals for resilience in the face of social and ecological crisis. The paradigm of sustainable territorial development presupposes a set of sustainability synthesized in the trinomial of economic efficiency, environmental and social effectiveness. Despite the efforts to revitalize the socio-cooperative project, it cannot be ignored that a socioeconomic model based on the paradigm of unlimited growth. It means, it cannot achieve a sustainable territorial development without changes in the forms of production and consumption without strengthening the socio-environmental effectiveness. The cooperative education model requires a greater strengthening of praxis (articulation between theory and practice). It is necessary in order to implement the pedagogy of social practice with inter and transdisciplinary vision, which makes clear the interrelation of economic and biosphere processes. Environmental and social sustainability will be the agenda of this century. Therefore, the cooperative education shall include the environmental issues, so that produces transformations in modes of production, consumption, and of life itself to create an awareness of the limits of economic rationality. Then, the ideal of human self-realization and social emancipation inevitably arises from the integration of the socio-ecological dimension. It can be said that cooperative education for the integral development of the person is a broad concept that encompasses from technical, to social and ethical education. Education is a central issue to the integral development and self-realization, promoting the autonomy, freedom, and responsibility, which represent an enormous potential for transforming and emancipating people. On the other hand, it contributes to the strengthening of anti-hegemonic values such as solidarity, cooperation, and autonomy, promoting critical awareness, which is the basis of the processes with an enormous transforming and emancipating potential. Arizmendiarrieta said that consciences had to be transformed in structures. It means social emancipation that is conducted through cooperative education as a critical pedagogy or for social transformation. It is concluded that new spaces are needed for cooperative reflection where cooperative education should be a tool that encourages space for debate, based on dialogical and participative dynamics to share and build cooperative meaning. Cooperative education is an interesting tool to promote the debate and the collective construction of proposals. The practice accumulated in recent years shows the lack of space to recreate the cooperative identity. An important part of the cooperative is that the members should be involved in the educational processes to assure the cooperative values. In this sense, cooperativism is characterized as a more humanized model of the economy, as the term social economy suggests.
   Cooperative education, in turn, allows spaces for debate to work identity and cooperative practice, develop feelings of belonging and affinity to the cooperative model. The cooperativism has the greatest challenge of incorporating intergenerational rights, not only socioeconomic but also environmental, with a more robust and resilient socio-business project in the face of climate change..

TI Social and economic impact of the Seed Accelerators: significant factors
   and implications for the social innovation

   GRADUATION
AB Accelerators are still an emerging tool pointed to speed up the birth and growth of innovative start-ups.
   The Seed Accelerator programs (SAPs) usually provide entrepreneurs with accommodation, mentoring and training during a short period of three to six months, and are believed to be useful for a more effective launch of start-ups. Due to their emergent nature, the impact and expectations of Seed Accelerators remains largely unknown. Most of them were established after 2010 and their track record is still insufficient to define trajectories and draw definitive conclusions. Notwithstanding, finding evidence on the accelerators impact and benefits at the economic, social and territorial levels, is a topic of undisputed attention.
   The few studies conducted on the subject so far, suggest a straightforward and positive impact over the hosted firms but only in the elite accelerators.
   The Seed Accelerator (SA) phenomenon is awaking interest amongst a broader number of social entrepreneurs and innovative start-ups developing projects with social impact, which can be hosted in social-driven accelerators, a format rapidly growing in Spain since the emergence in 2011 of SocialNest. The mounting range of innovations with social content is opening up new business opportunities for social technological start-ups, defined as new ventures that develop and deploy technology-driven solutions to address social needs in a financially sustainable manner.
   The main purpose of this study is to approximately assess, for the first time, the Seed Accelerators capacity to make a social contribution in terms of employment generated by the new ventures participating in the acceleration programs. The originality lies in being pioneer in identifying the factors underlying a higher impact of these initiatives in terms of employment and other key performance indicators. This objective will be empirically fulfilled through a sample of Seed Accelerators, assembled from an online Global Seed Accelerator survey with data on SAs and the accelerated companies that have participated in Accelerator Programs. Three samples are finally built: the global sample with 116 SAs, a second sample including only the 63 SAs with at least one round of investment over 1milion $, and a third sample comprising only the 33 SAs having managed to "exit" one company for at least 1milion $.
   The model of analysis is based on the Business Incubators literature due to the newness of the SAPs with practically no previous studies having assessed these initiatives yet. The dependent variable is the Average number of employees per company. The model contains 12 independent variables, most of them indicators of performance of the Seed Accelerator programs, leading to four hypotheses to be tested.
   - Hypothesis 1 expects the SAs located in the USA to excel in the main performance indicators.
   - Hypothesis 2 expects better prospects on the SAs hosting start-ups in a more advanced development stage and accounting for a larger number of employees per company.
   - Hypothesis 3 expects the SAs with at least one company receiving investment above 1milion $ to be able to create more employment and reach better performance indicators.
   - The bivariate statistical analysis is the method selected to test these three hypotheses.
   - Hypothesis 4 will unveil the variables more significant for the creation of employment in the start-ups participating in SAs programs.
   A GLM Gamma model has been built in order to test this last hypothesis, giving rise to two significant variables: the rounds of investment and the amount of investment per company. Consequently, and in accordance to our results, the SAs better positioned in these two investment-led variables, are the ones displaying a larger capacity to generate employment and attaining a broader social impact.
   The study uncovers the key factors underlying the generation of employment by the start-ups hosted in SA programs, hence becoming helpful to those institutions and agents, public and private, promoting supportive programs to the emergence of innovative new ventures. As anticipated by Hypothesis 1, the SAs located in the USA effectively outperform the others in most indicators and their participated start-ups tend to create more employment. Moving to Hypothesis 2, the leading SAs in terms of employment per company are the ones hosting a larger number of companies and enjoying better performance ratios. However, the generation of employment in the SAs with at least one company receiving investment above 1milion $ is not bigger than in the rest, a finding leading to reject Hypothesis 3.
   These findings raise several conclusions and implications for management. First, investors effectively play an outstanding role in the success of both the SAs programs and the accelerated start-ups. Therefore, in order to increase the impact of SAs in terms of generation of employment, the SAs promoters should be especially proactive in the attraction of investors, mainly Venture capitalists and invite them to close investment rounds in the hosted start-ups. Our study reveals the SAs with the highest social impact, measured in terms of new employment, are those having succeeded in closing rounds of investment and consequently, reaching a higher amount of investment per company.
   As expected, the SAs located in the USA and those hosting a larger number of start-ups, also outperform the others in terms of employment. This advantageous position exhibited by the USA Accelerators most likely obeys to their longer experience and the broader support received from investors. In order to become attractive to entrepreneurs and increase their social impact, the promoters of Seed Accelerators in Spain should weave stronger ties with agents endowed with investment capacity, including family offices, ventures capitalists, large corporations or successful entrepreneurs. Otherwise, the advantages a SA can offer to the tenant firms and their potential impact over the territory get diluted.
   The findings also open the door to new proposals for the policy makers.
   - First, an effective selection system of projects and entrepreneurs is a first condition worth bearing in mind, not always met by the existing SAs in Spain.
   - Second, it seems beneficial at the social level to promote SAs specialized in specific sectors and industries, sponsored and supported by large corporations from the region. This would result in new start-ups created more attached to the territory and ready to attain higher levels of employment generation and social impact.
   - Third, in order to attract more start-ups and upgrade their chances to survive and grow, the high education offer should be flexible and rapidly adapt to the changing needs in skills and abilities by the top technological sectors.
   - Finally, the ability to attract and retain in the territory a sufficient number of investors, mainly Business Angels and Venture capitalists, is essential to the emergence of new SAs and to maintain the existing ones.
   Insofar limitations of the study, the relatively small size of the sample has prevented the application of more advanced statistical techniques.
   Finally, a methodological limitation, difficult to overcome, lies in how to gauge the actual role played by the Accelerators in the success of participating firms. This role at the early stages is clearly crucial but the question of whether these start-ups would have been equally successful without SA intervention remains unresolved. Undoubtedly, further research is needed to address the following question: What proportion of start-ups might not have prospered without the aid of an accelerator?
   For future research, we plan to build a broad sample of start-ups in Spain, making the distinction between those participating in SAs programs and the rest. The purpose would lie in finding out the specific advantages of SAs and their effectiveness in generating start-ups able to create new and highly qualified employment.

AB Economy for the common good model (ECG) proposes the use of different instruments, measures and indicators to develop an ethical management in the organizations. Such proposal implicates the organizations involved to give priority to ethical and social banking and, also, the employment of alternative financial instruments. This way, money stops being considered as an end by itself and starts to be a mean to serve firm's growth and human development.
   The present study has as main purpose to analyze the role played by ethical finances in ECG model through the criteria and sub-criteria included in the Common Good Matrix (CGM). CGM relates some specific human rights values and principles to the different stakeholders in the firm. Then, it sets up a number of variables and indicators to measure the organizations' contribution to the common good.
   Therefore, the current study analyzes the relationship between ECG model and Ethical finances from both points of view, macro-economic and micro-economic, as ECG model aims to have some impact at both levels. To do so, authors have analyzed the CGM (version 4.1) relating the five different types of value comprised in the model to the firm's main stakeholders, playing special attention to funders.
   Consequently, the present study depicts in an accurate way which are the proposals made by ECG model to implement an ethical financial management in whatever type of organizations. Although such proposals are addressed to both levels, macroeconomic (Estates' economic and financial behavior within the international context) and microeconomic (Firms' behavior in terms of ethical funding), the present research focuses on the microeconomic level.
   ECG model is clearly committed to ethical and social finances development at macro and microeconomic levels. Thus, through one of its main tools as it is CG Balance sheet, ECG model proposes a number of criteria and measures aimed at the improvement of financial management based on ethics and social responsibility. Above all, ECG model considers the firms themselves to be the ones able to promote social and ethical finances by including ECG principles and values in their day by day management. In this sense, firms should manage their finances from a social and ethical approach. To do so, they can collaborate with ethical and social banks, employ alternative funding tools and, also, implement sustainable investment projects which make social and environmental impact on the locations where they operate.
   In Spain, ethical banking has not had the historical tradition it has had in central and northern Europe, in fact ethical bank deposits suppose 1% of the overall Spanish financial institutions. Moreover, the financial crisis has supposed a significant lose for proximity and social banking in Spain (Saving Banks and Co-operative Banks). As a consequence, in the Spanish context the offer in terms of social and ethical banking services is very limited. However, since 2008, ethical banks operating in Spain have increased considerably their share of deposits and customers served. On the other hand, new non-banking funding initiatives based on social and ethical principles have been launched. This is the case of financial services co-operatives, integral co-operative, self-funding communities, time banks, barter networks, social currencies and collaborative finances. Such initiatives wide the options for financial cooperation among SMEs and social and environmental projects development.
   By means of ethical financial management, ECG can lever financial inclusion. This is important for societies because previous research has demonstrated that financial exclusion turns into social exclusion and poverty. Financial exclusion involves that over time more and more people and organizations are excluded from banking financing because of the office closures and credit constraints. SMEs and new ventures are the firms more likely to experience financial exclusion.
   Moreover, commercial banks usually undervalue social and environmental outcomes. Hence, ethical and social banks are the ones that though their ethical committees integrate social, environmental and ethical criteria into their viability analysis to evaluate invest projects. Consequently, such type banks are able to deliver financial inclusion by operating in territories where the potential for financial profitability is lower (rural areas or depressed territories) and launching financial instruments adapted to the needs of these specific areas or to the need of the enterprises with more difficulties to get access to credit. Thus the firms that implement ECG model have ethical and social banking as potential cooperative partners to set up durable and balanced commercial relationships, which turns into an ethical and sustainable financial management.
   For all what has been previously pointed, one can infer the need for widening and spreading ethical and social criteria not only to the financial management of non-financial businesses, but also to financial institutions. Being ECG model appropriate to do it as it holds the suitable tools to develop such process. Due to this, in our opinion it could be of interest for both, scholars and practitioners, to perform an empirical study to quantify how much the firms that have implemented ECG model are contributing to the development of ethical financial management. There are already empirical studies that analyze the entrepreneurial outcomes in terms of sustainability following the complementary three dimensions: social, environmental and economic. For us, it could be interesting to perform further empirical research with similar features but focused on the firms that have implemented ECG balance sheet.
   In the same way, for us it could be important that public bodies design and put into practice economic and tax benefits aimed at the businesses which operate with ethical and social banking. In this sense, one important point may be the prioritization of ECG firms in regards of public procurement. Thus, public sector would stimulate businesses to integrate ethical and social criteria into their making decisions process through ECG model.
   Finally, the main contribution of the present research paper relies on the study of the existing relationship between ethical finances and ECG model. Given that there are not yet any publication relating such research topics. As it has been said before, there are a number of research papers published on ethical finances and also some others on ECG model but none of them relates both research topics.

AB Webinars have become an important aspect of many extension outreach programs, especially for large research projects that cover wide geographic regions. Evaluation of webinar impact is important to funders and stakeholders alike. Surveys to gather direct and indirect data can be used to evaluate webinars for their overall utility. The results can inform funders of program success and also serve as an indicator of the continued viability of webinar programming for extension audiences. The Northern Grapes Project administered a webinar series on topics related to grape (Vitis sp.) and wine production from 2012 through 2016. Thirty webinars were delivered to an audience of 3083, with nearly an additional 2400 views of recorded webinars. To estimate the value of the series, we modified two models, one that estimated viewer time investment and one that calculated the "green savings." In addition, we surveyed webinar participants, asking them how much they would pay to watch a live webinar and access the archives, as well as how much money they had earned and/or saved from the information presented. Together, the models and survey indicated a webinar series value of nearly $3.4 million.

AB Introduction: Gender differences in sexual responses and cognitive and emotional processing to romantic and sexually explicit stimuli have been reported. However, these differences seem to depend on the automaticity of the task that is being used, thus suggesting that gender differences may be the result of specific mechanisms rather than a generalized effect.
   Aim: To expand previous basic processes research on gender differences to romantic vs sexually explicit stimuli, focusing on potential differentiating mechanisms influencing male and female sexual responses, we aim to investigate gender differences on automatic attention to sexual stimuli, and to test its relationship with sexual excitation proneness.
   Methods: 26 women and 30 men (heterosexual) performed an automatic attention task, in which romantic and sexually explicit stimuli were presented as distractors, that is, stimuli to be ignored, while a concurrent letter discrimination task was performed, followed by a self-report task assessing subjective sexual and emotional responses to the stimuli.
   Main Outcome Measures: Percentage of accuracy and response times (RTs) to discriminate the target letters were used as markers of automatic attention, with lower accuracy and longer RTs reflecting a higher degree of attentional capture by the distractor stimuli (romantic and sexually explicit). Participants completed self-report ratings on emotional valence, general arousal, and sexual arousal toward romantic and sexually explicit stimuli. They further reported on their sexual excitation proneness.
   Results: Findings revealed that sexually explicit pictures yielded more automatic attention capture. However, this effect was superseded by pornography consumption, which likely reflects a habituation mechanism. Also, data revealed gender-x type of picture interaction effects only at the self-report task, with men rating sexually explicit stimuli as more sexually exciting, and women rating these stimuli as less pleasant. No relationship was found between automatic attention proxies and sexual excitation proneness.
   Clinical Translation: While therapeutic strategies are used as tools to improve attention to sexual stimuli (and, hence, increase sexual arousal), the current findings suggest that the specific pathways by which attention influences sexual response are still to be established. Also, gender differences on the subjective appraisal of sex stimuli suggest that therapeutic approaches, consisting on exposure techniques, must recognize gender specificities.
   Strengths & Limitations: To our knowledge, this is the first study applying an automatic attention task to the field of sex research, thus adding new inputs to the topic of attention, gender differences, and sexual response. However, there is very limited research in the field of automatic attention, which may limit the interpretation of our findings, at the moment.
   Conclusion: Whereas both genders do not seem to differ in automatic attention toward romantic and sexually explicit stimuli, their responses do differ in their subjective appraisal of the stimuli. Furthermore, despite theoretical assumptions on the relationship between attention and sexual response, automatic attention seemed not to be related to sexual excitation proneness.

AB Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have drastically altered the way information is generated and disseminated. These platforms allow their users to report events and express their opinions toward these events. The profusion of data generated through social media has proved to have the potential for improving the efficiency of existing traffic management systems and transportation analytics. This study complements existing literature by proposing a framework to evaluate transit riders' opinion about quality of transit service using Twitter data. Although previous studies used keyword search to extract transit-related tweets, the extracted tweets can still be noisy and might not be relevant to transit quality of service at all. In this study, we leverage topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning technique, to sift tweets that are relevant to the actual user experience of the transit system. Sentiment analysis is further performed based on the tweet-pertopic index we developed, to gauge transit riders' feedback and explore the underlying reasons causing their dissatisfaction on the service. This framework can be potentially quite useful to transit agencies for user-oriented analysis and to assist with investment decision making.

AB Working Memory (MT) has served as a predictor for phenomena such as school performance in mathematics, reading comprehension and learning of students with atypical development. This has given it a key role in cognitive studies. Due to the importance that WM has taken, it becomes relevant to explore models that explain this construct to bring these proposals closer to researchers who are becoming familiar with this topic. The present article presents and compares the multicomponent model of Baddeley and Hitch (1974) and its subsequent updates (Baddeley, 2000, 2012, 2017) with the integrated attention and memory model of Cowan (1988, 1995, 2005). From the detailed review of both proposals a comparison is made using as criteria the role of memory in the model, the equivalence between the components of both models and the way in which the information is stored and accessed. The findings of this review show that although there are equivalences among some of the elements of both proposals, the different emphases of both models result in different interpretations of the empirical underpinnings and the functioning of WM in relation to the roles of the long-term memory and attention.

AB The study of sustained attention, understood as the ability through which we maintain alertness to select stimuli during a long period of time, has encountered great development in the last decades. This has led to the publication of diverse studies related to attention in adults and its changes regarding age. Nevertheless, research on child population is limited, especially regarding the influence of factors that may determine developmental trajectories of sustained attention. Objective. To analyze the content, method and contributions of a group of studies which report a relation of different variables with sustained attention in childhood and adolescence. Method. A literary review of 17 papers on the subject was conducted using the V of Gowin as an instrument of analysis of objectives, keywords, theoretical models, methodology, results from the associated factors and authors' recommendations. Results. The analyzed papers report that age, sex, intelligence, aggression, anxiety, oppositionism, hyperactivity, emotional reactivity, sleep habits, family environment and socioeconomic level, were all considered factors related to the development of sustained attention in childhood and adolescence. Discussion. In this chapter, the focus relies on the importance of acknowledging the factors related to the performance of sustained attention. This will increase the comprehension on the topic and will help to dimension the complexity of this cognitive process. Moreover, the consideration of these factors is suggested in the process of evaluation and rehabilitation of sustained attention.

AB Roadworks are perhaps the most controversial topic in transport professional field. On one hand, they are a necessity to assure the current and future functionality of the traffic network, while on the other, they are seen as a major disturbance by road users with concerns for excessive travel time delays. The impact of roadworks is usually analysed at a local level however the network-wide effects are crucial to ensure reliable travel times. Moreover the analysis usually focusses on private cars and the reliability impact on public transport services are too important to ignore. This paper investigates the impact of roadworks undertaken on a given road link over wider parts of the network and assesses travel time reliability for both cars and buses. This research involves setting up of a conventional network assignment model to arrive at the route choice of drivers as a result of the roadworks and then integrates the outcomes with a microsimulation model to generate space-time trajectories to arrive at travel times of individual vehicles. We adopted a reliability measure from the literature to compute travel time reliability of a given type of vehicle by unique origin-destination (O-D) pair combinations and also more generally to provide a wider picture at an aggregated network level. The method was tested on a real life network in England, and travel time reliability results were analysed both at the network scale and significant O-D pair level for private cars and bus routes.

AB This paper provides a brief description of the NASA Living With a Star (LWS) Institute special section on low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite drag: Science and operational impact. The goals of the LWS institute are to (a) review the current status of atmospheric drag research and operational concerns for LEO satellites, (b) identify and understand the major issues in atmospheric drag estimation, and (c) provide recommendations for future improvement in our ability to provide nowcasts of satellite drag. This special section presents the progress made by the 17 institute members of the 11 participating institutes from four countries as well as additional contributions from scientists who were not part of the original NASA LWS LEO drag team. Contributions cover topics in measurement and modeling of solar extreme ultraviolet inputs, thermospheric neutral density profiles, changes in composition and total density, and satellite conjunction and orbit prediction. Errors in the thermosphere density specification are the dominant source in uncertainty of LEO drag estimation and satellite conjunction. The consensus opinion is that significant funded future effort needs to address and improve measurements and modeling of the thermospheric neutral density and composition under different solar and geomagnetic conditions.

AB Completion of the activities within optimal time and cost plays a significant role in construction projects. Recently, project managers have to decrease the total durations and costs of the projects more than before due to the competitive environment. Mostly, decision makers usually seek different alternatives which reduce time and cost. As well as being one of the most major topics of construction management, this problem called time-cost trade-off (TCTO) which is extremely difficult to solve with traditional mathematical methods. In recent years, metaheuristic algorithms are outstanding methods in this field due to their flexible and adaptable structure. This paper presents a new algorithm called F-PSO which consists of hybridizing Firefly Algorithm (FA) with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In this method, the problem is modelled with various execution modes to select the optimal one for each activity. The applicability and validity of the proposed method is confirmed by performing 18-activity project as a benchmark problem. Comparison of numerical results with different metaheuristic algorithms demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of F-PSO with regard to optimality of time and cost outcomes.

AB A fluorescence of shape-capture technologies at many different scales, including synchrotron, CT, micro/nano-CT, laser scanning, and photogrammetry, has led to a proliferation of digital data in bioarchaeology. The question remains how these new 3D datasets, alongside traditional bioarchaeological data, can be disseminated, and what ethical concerns are raised by trying to bring a sensitive topic into the 'Open Access' era. A survey of current resources and policies suggest the need for establishing best-practice standards. This paper outlines a sample of current resources, alongside modes of access and dissemination strategies to develop a picture of online Digital Bioarchaeological Data (DBD) use.

AB Information propagation plays a significant role in online social networks, mining the latent information produced became crucial to understand how information is disseminated. It can be used for market prediction, rumor controlling, and opinion monitoring among other things. Thus, in this paper, an information dissemination model based on dynamic individual interest is proposed. The basic idea of this model is to extract effective topic of interest of each user overtime and identify the most relevant topics with respect to seed users. A set of experiments on real twitter dataset showed that the proposed dynamic prediction model which applies machine learning techniques outperformed traditional models that only rely on words extracted from tweets.

AB Weather forecasting is a natural phenomenon which has some chaotic changes happening with the passage of time. It has become an essential topic of research due to some abrupt scenarios of weather. As the data of forecast is nonlinear and follows some irregular trends and patterns, there are many traditional techniques (the literature like nonlinear statistics) to work on the efficiency of models to make prediction better than previous models. However, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has so far evolved out to be as a better way to improve the accuracy and reliability. The ANN is one of the most fastest growing technique of machine learning considered as non-linear predictive models to perform classification and prediction weather forecasts maximum temperature for the whole days (365) of the year. Therefore, a multi-layered neural network is designed and trained with the existing dataset and obtained a relationship between the existing non-linear parameters of weather. Eleven weather features were used to perform classification of weather into four types. Furthermore, twenty training examples from 1997-2015 were used to predict eleven weather features. The results revealed that by increasing the number of hidden layers, the trained neural network can classify and predict the weather variables with less error.

AB China faces an aging tsunami. By the end of 2016, the number of older adults aged 60 and older reached 230 million. This number is projected to reach 418 million by 2035 and peak at 487 million by 2053. The number of individuals aged 80 and older, the oldest adults, reached 26 million and continues to grow by 1 million a year. The socioeconomic context, characterized by an inverted pyramid family structure and the number of empty nesters, has greatly compromised traditional Chinese family support for older adults. This article aims to provide an overview of geriatrics development in China. It begins with a brief account of the dramatic demographic shift, major socioeconomic factors, China's healthcare system, and reform related to senior health with a historical perspective. It then describes recent advances in government policy and support and development of a geriatrics physician workforce, care models, primary care networks, and privately owned senior care facilities and support services. Although it is impossible to cover all aspects of the topic, it is hoped that this article provides readers an overall picture of Chinese geriatrics and senior healthcare development in a complex and evolving healthcare system. Geriatrics communities in the United States and around the world will undoubtedly learn and benefit from the unparalleled and continued efforts to address this unprecedented opportunity and challenge in China.

ID SPUR GEAR
AB Enhancing the efficiency of gearing,systems is an important topic for the development of future aero-engines with low specific fuel consumption. An evaluation of its structure and performance is mandatory in order to optimize the design as well as maximize its efficiency. Mechanical power losses are usually distinguished into two main categories: load-dependent and load-independent losses. The former are all those associated with the transmission of torque, while the latter are tied to the fluid dynamics of the environment, which surrounds the gears. The relative magnitude of these phenomena is dependent on the operative conditions of the transmission: load-dependent losses are predominant at slow speeds and high torque conditions, load-independent mechanisms become prevailing in high speed applications, like in turbomachinery. A new test rig was designed for investigating windage power losses resulting by a single spur gear rotating in a free oil environment. The test rig allows the gear to rotate at high speed within a box where pressure and temperature conditions can be set and monitored. An electric spindle, which drives the system, is connected to the gear through a high accuracy torque meter, equipped with a speedometer providing the rotating velocity. The test box is,fitted with optical accesses in order to perform particle image velocitnetry (PIV) measurements for investigating the,flow field surrounding the rotating gear. The experiment has been computationally replicated, performing Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations in the context of conventional eddy viscosity models, achieving good agreement for all of the speed of rotations.

SO CHAOS
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEMS; PLOTS; PATTERNS
AB Studies of conversational encounters typically employ manual discourse analysis methods to reveal participants' topic management patterns, usually focusing on turn-by-turn interactions within a specific social context. These analyses, while powerful, are time-consuming to apply and can prove difficult to generalize. Recurrence analysis has recently been applied to discourse datasets to model how individual terms and concepts recur over whole conversation time scales and relate patterns of recurrence to topic management practices by individuals. In this paper, we propose a new multi-level quantitative method for modelling the topical interaction dynamics in conversation based on conceptual recurrence quantification analysis. The new protocol develops a hierarchy of speakers and their interactions, and partitions recurrence based on these groups. The new protocol is evaluated against expert human coding of television broadcast interviews. Our analysis reveals topic use patterns and networks of conceptual engagement (person-person and group-group) that show experts preferentially engaging with other experts rather than with laypeople, findings that are consistent with prior expectations for this discourse, although never before expressed as metrics. The studies provide a starting point for new computational protocols to provide fast, semi-automated methods for measuring the degree of conceptual interaction between individuals and groups.
