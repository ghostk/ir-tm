US election: Trump calls Hillary Clinton a 'bigot'
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has accused Democratic rival Hillary Clinton of being a "bigot" in his latest appeal to minority voters.
Mr Trump added that Mrs Clinton and the Democratic party had taken advantage of the African-American community.
The Democratic presidential nominee called out Mr Trump for questioning the citizenship of President Barack Obama and for failing to disavow former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, adding that he was "peddling bigotry and prejudice and paranoia".
Mr Trump took aim at Mrs Clinton during a campaign stop in Jackson, Mississippi, on Wednesday, where he was joined by Britain's outgoing UKIP leader Nigel Farage.

Mr Farage, who is viewed as a major force behind the UK's exit from the EU, told Trump supporters to "get your walking boots on" and begin campaigning.
In recent days, Mr Trump has attempted to court African-Americans after failing to gain support among this key voting bloc.
So it's not exactly stunning that Donald Trump is attempting to undermine what a bedrock of Hillary Clinton's campaign - her support among minority voters, particularly blacks.
Mr Trump's calling Mrs Clinton a bigot in a few speeches is likely to bounce off the Democratic nominee if that's all there is. A wealthy - white - New York billionaire telling blacks how terrible their lives are under Democrats is just not likely fly.
Last week, Mr Trump made a direct appeal to black voters during a rally in Michigan, where he told a nearly all-white crowd that African-Americans "are living in poverty" and "their schools are no good".
Mrs Clinton is due to speak later in Reno, Nevada, where she will accuse Mr Trump of "embracing extremism and presenting a divisive and dystopian view of America".
